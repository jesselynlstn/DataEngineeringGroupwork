Comment,S25 Ultra,"Note 20 ultra user here. It's still going pretty good and is the Last gen of galaxy phones to rock a memory card. Have a shattered back glass and a couple of scratches on the front, from countless falls since last 5 yrs & a 1 story fall onto a rock bed. If I get a good trade in for broken screen, will upgrade to the S25U. 

On the side note of, last few generations of phones being similar, I guess on a slab phone how much more can they keep inventing? Still Samsung was the one which came with curved screen, foldables and flaps, the S pen, wireless charging and charging other phones, crazy zooms in smartphones etc. And then some of the other manufacturers followed.
(some of the features I mentioned may or may not have been brought on first by Samsung but they were one of the 1st to adapt at least). I understand some are more gimmicky than practical like the curved screens etc, but they are at least bringing out somethings new that catches people's interest.

Compared to other manufacturers(üçè) that take out options (headphone jack etc) disguised as courage and somehow that catches a trend and then other comoanys jump on to the boat.

So in an industry stagnant with innovation, my money, whenever I am ready to upgrade of course, will most likely go to Samsung or if some other phone really beats the features that I am so used to now. 

Until we get that perfect phone that checks all the boxes, get the one that gets the most. Good luck üëç",6,,0.028,0.125,0.9855

Comment,S25,"Well, some do, some don't. My last Samsung was like 13-15 years ago. Once I switched to OnePlus then Vivo, I never looked back. There is really nothing special about better marketed companies that have been longer on the market. They just price their products higher and count on the brand logo to sell their stuff. Not for my taste. Once OnePlus pretty much stopped releasing flagship killers around OnePlus 8 Pro and switched to mid/mid+ tier. I left it for Vivo. No need to get attached to a brand, I just get the best I can for the price.

Comment,S25 Ultra,"It's funny in a way as many of us love our existing Notes or Ultras and would keep them if the software wasn't out of date, (Note 10+ here) and the batteries were not getting tired. In a way with them not really changing since the S21U? Aren't they just giving us more of what we love? Yes for some the SD card and the headphone jack are a loss. 

With the tech in mobile tech maturing to this level it has, those that don't give the majority the same as they always had usually fail. 

I'm thinking of LG's I've owned that tried some fun things like the LG G5 with the cartridge swap batteries, the V60 with the dualscreen cases, the X-wing, and a whole V series with excellent audio DACs. They are gone now. 

They couldn't get traction. The same for Sony in North America. HTC, Nokia etc. They are either gone or pulled out of North America. Motorola almost died before ownership changes but have found a niche that's not mainstream for many. 

I'm not sure I'm a fan of the latest S25 reminding me of my iPhone 13 Max form factor, but I'm happy about the Samsung hardware/software and the upgraded chipset.

I'm just a bit upset that my S21U only has 4 years of support. I might even use it for 1 year after the support ends. I just see no reason to upgrade from such a fantastic device. The rest of you can keep padding Samsung's bottom line üòÜ",1,,0.049,0.223,0.9838

Comment,S25 Ultra,"I don't know about the last, my latest was a used note 10 plus. Now I have a 24 Ultra.
Stylus is pretty much welcome, but I don't want to limit that too much. The cameras are IMO a lot better (4K/120FPS is worth it alone XD), the anti reflective screen and the gigantic battery life do make it worth in my book. Is the 25 ultra a big upgrade? Probably not. 
If we talk performance by the way, I really notice the bump from the tab S8 plus (Snapdragon 8 gen 1) to the gen 3. On the tablet I have sometimes YouTube and a game (matching story, I don't think it's that demanding) open in split screen. Even audio tends to stutter - sometimes up to half a minute. 
Samsung is for me the only option right now. From Xiaomi I got a bad Mi 12 and my wife a bad Mi 10 lite, Google has a weaker processor, huawei is extremely interesting, but hard to get. 

Oppo and OnePlus ... I don't know. I feel like they are a little fresh in the ultra phone market. Honor too. Though an honor trifold would be fucking bonkers. If only I had the money ...

Sony would be an alternative, but they are also seriously expensive - why not go a little deeper in your wallet and get the pen, which I do frequently use. The software is also better on Samsung.

Also, fuck Apple. Amazing battery life and performance, but everything else is shit.

Of course, that all is at least partly true for the regular 24 and the 24 plus.

Edit: about the removal of the SD card: fuck them. I like to watch movies on there, so 256 GB is minimum. But I also want to shoot good video, so I got the 512 GB. I don't care about the headphone jack though, I almost exclusively use bluetooth anyways. On the laptop too, with mouse and keyboard.

Comment,S25 Ultra,if you take advantage of Samsung trade in program and get a new phone every year with a storage boost for around $350.00 it's a great deal in my mind to get a fresh phone every year. this in the USA anyway. just my opinion and I update every year if the awesome trade in continue. they usually add other little perks as well if you send in your reservation.

Comment,S25,"I think the biggest issue with phones now is that the tech and the hardware are kinda maxed out. Phone sizes are already just on the borderline of being too big to use 1 handed. Nobody wants to go back to the small iPhone days. The screens are probably as good a quality as they really can be. People don't really notice the differences year to year. 

Cameras can get better, but the prices of the phones will get bigger too. The cameras are already so good that the software is what makes pictures better. 

Chip sets get better every year, but it's hard to notice for a regular person year to year. And the batteries can't get much bigger without expanding the phone size. 

AI is what is really gonna make phones better along with software.  Phones have just reached their limits for now until a big breakthrough is made. I think Foldable phones are gonna be the future. They will eventually replace tablets.",49,,0.009,0.123,0.9664

Comment,S25,"If you're on an S23U or newer, I'd see little reason to upgrade, especially with the S-Pen downgrade. 

I, on the other hand, still use an N20U.  I don't use all the capabilities of the S-Pen, so the downgrade is minimal to me. I mainly use the pen for notes, selecting small text, etc.   So I am keeping my N20U for the fact that the screen is still great and it has an SD card slot for movies and music. I camp, hike, and backpack a bit. A lot of national and state parks won't have wifi access and little to any signal. I have to keep a song and movie/show library for when I want to listen to a song or relax after a long hike with dinner and a movie. I don't do full PCT/AT, etc, so keeping the Note is a no-brainer.  Could I take my tablet? Sure. It takes up more space in my backpack and weighs more. And I'm unsure about the water resistance. I keep my tech in a waterproof back, but accidents happen. 

The only depressing part is really how little the upgrades have been over the last 5 years. I'll my probably keep my S25U at worst 6 years unless there's a MASSIVE change in phones during that time. I was a Note fanboy since Note 2. I got the 3, 4, and on until I skipped 10 for 20. And at points, there were not massive changes. My N20U keeps a decent all-day charge unless a lot is running in the background or I use it heavily. Battery runs hot while charging sometimes.  Replaced S-Pen twice. The only scratch is above the flash, but not interfering with it. It has done me well and will hold up as media storage in its second life.",3,,0.043,0.034,-0.7705

Comment,S25 Ultra,"This post doesn't feel like a usage review. More like a stats page with thoughts on other devices. I don't entirely disagree with expressed views. Just doesn't match the title. 

My personal experience so far. 

Both me and my wife pre-ordered our s25 ultras. Her battery for the first two days was horrific! We almost returned the phone. But on the third day. It miraculously improved. Mine has been decent. Feels about the same as the s24 ultra when it was new. The iPhone still lasts longer. Especially in standby mode. 

Other than that. The new shape or the phone, which people feel isn't different enough from the past generations, at least to look at, actually feels amazing in the hand. It's a significant improvement. Doesn't dig into the fingers. I use all my phones without a case or screen protectors. It feels lighter than my iPhone 16 pro max. Maybe it's the balance of the phone. I know the actual figures are close. 

Haven't really tested the camera out. But it's fine. No complaints. The shutter speed has definitely improved. For someone who uses the iPhone along with android, this would always stick out like a sore thumb. Camera results are okay. Both take decent pictures.

And after many years of Android absence, it still feels not fully ""integrated"". Different apps with same functionality for ex..

Comment,S25,How was the S Pen downgraded?,3,,0.0,0.0,0.0
Comment,S25 Ultra,"This actually feels like a solid review. My takeaway would be the S pen. This would make me lean towards S25 Plus to be better than the S25 Ultra. The S pen downgrade is something that I acknowledge, but I don't think most people would ever need the S pen. It's a good addition (when it's done right), but it's not a necessity. The S25 Plus has a lot in common with the Ultra like a close to same battery size and the same processor (which is not the case for the previous S24 lineup where only the Ultra gets the Snapdragon 8 gen processor)

In short, if you really feel like getting the S25 lineup, the highest you should go for is probably the S25 Plus. Maybe the base S25 if you want a smaller form factor

Edit:

I guess people hated my statement so I'll make it clear, do you genuinely think that everyone who's thinking of buying the Ultra is going to use the S-Pen? If so than sorry, maybe I'm wrong in your eyes.

But If you want me to think that it is worth the S-Pen and an extra 100mah and maybe better camera just get the S24 Ultra. You'll get a better deal than the new one.",6,,0.049,0.132,0.9432
Comment,S25 Ultra,"Thank you for your thoughts.

I think an important piece of context is to ask: what phone did you upgrade from? Many reviewers are reviewing the S25 Ultra from a year over year perspective (compared to the S24 Ultra) and not compared to an older device that's been beat to hell and is barely holding on (like a heavily used Note 20). I'd dare say that the average consumer is going to fall closer to the latter than the former, which means that most reviews are pretty worthless.",2,,0.075,0.101,0.128
Comment,S25,"This was a well reasoned review. I've also switched from the S24U. The S25U is a bit of an 'S -year' phone but that's not to say it's a bad phone. In all the key metrics it's near the top for sure. And in terms of general use it's definitely improved Vs the S25U. Battery life is better in my experience. Fluidity whilst moving between apps is excellent, probably iPhone level. Screen is lovely and I love the anti reflective coating. Camera has definitely improved, with it taking sharper pictures at both zoom and non zoom. S24U had this issue where it would take washed out looking pics in certain scenarios where there was bright light. I would upgrade for that reason alone tbh. Ergonomically I recalled liked the curved sides of the 24 phone, I miss those tbh. But on the flip side I appreciate the curved corners of the 25. I think they should've retained the curved sides and potentially gave it curved corners ü§∑.

To summarise you could argue Vivo is the best camera, oneplus has the best battery. But overall they can't compete on all of the metrics. With Sammy you have consistency. Plus with Trump in power there's no telling when the other phones are gonna get banned anyway.",2,,0.078,0.244,0.9941

On Facebook you can't zoom in to a posted photo. It glitches out freezes if you try. 

Also they went way overboard on the ai software for the moon shots. 

With the 22 Ultra I was able to get impeccable shots of the moon no matter the time of day or light conditions. 

With the 24 unless the moon is high in the sky you can't get a shot of it , it really pixilates the moon with digital noise. 

On the 22 Ultra I got a beautiful shot of a redwing blackbird singing in to the moon (the moon is behind him who is in silhouette) .

Sorry for the novel. So my question is are you able to zoom in to photos on Facebook without the freeze, and have they calmed the ai down so you can just get the 22 Ultra quality moon photos?

Comment,S25 Ultra,"I‚Äôve partnered with Samsung, and in my opinion, I can tell you that the Galaxy S25 Ultra is absolutely worth the upgrade. I totally get why you‚Äôd be on the fence, well cause phones are a big investment. But after getting hands-on time with my friend‚Äôs S25 Ultra, I can confidently say this phone is next-level (dare I say, out of this ""Galaxy"").

The two features that blew me away are¬†**Night Video**¬†and¬†**Audio Eraser**. Night Video makes low-light shots look crisp and cinematic, even in dim settings like concerts or bonfires. And Audio Eraser? Absolute game-changer. It removes background noise from videos, so you don‚Äôt get stuck with wind noise or random chatter when you‚Äôre trying to record a special moment. This comes in extra handy when I'm recording at concerts and awfully sing-along (truthfully no one wants to hear me sing).

Then there‚Äôs the¬†**200MP camera**, which captures insane detail! I saw my friend take a zoomed-in photo at a sports game, and it looked like they were right on the field. Plus, the battery life is crazy good, lasting well beyond a full day even with heavy use. There's also a **LOG** feature that desaturates your photo colors, making it so much easier to color grade and make all of those clips/photos look cohesive together when editing.

If you‚Äôre holding onto an older phone, I‚Äôd say this is the perfect time to upgrade. What‚Äôs holding you back? Any specific features you‚Äôre looking for?",1,,0.043,0.148,0.9849

Comment,S25 Ultra,"I'm a content creator, and yes, I do partner with Samsung Galaxy, but I've reviewed and looked into a lot of the devices you are talking about. But the S25 Ultra really stands above the rest as far as quality.

When you talk about the display, you have to remember that Samsung has the anti-reflective display, which is MASSIVE. Being able to use the display outdoors is a REALLY big deal. You said yourself that the battery life is the best.

As far as cameras, remember that in the US, remember that a lot of these phones you may mention aren't available in the US. We have 10 bit video now with the S25 Ultra, and I'd argue Samsung has the best video quality out of any phone. Whether you think the camera is the best or not (those debates are always subjective) the versatility is massive, and again, why compare with overseas competitors if you are a US person? The S25 Ultra has the most versatility, best video quality, and yes, the pictures look good.

You also have the best processor. And as far as software, I've tried other phones, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra is just better. That's my honest opinion. You also have Samsung DeX. And better updates overall.

Everyone has their own opinion, but I think the s25 Ultra is still the best overall package. People will debate some things like value, but man, I 100% think it's still the best.",1,,0.01,0.229,0.9972

Comment,S25 Ultra,"I miss square corners and of course the lack of Bluetooth on the pen is a little bit irritating but the only time I really used to it was when taking photos where I wanted to hold the phone as far away as possible so that I can get more in a selfie or if I wanted to set the phone down and get a photo far away and take the picture remotely, but 90% of the time I forgot.

I absolutely enjoy the display. As you said it is sharper the colors are better and overall it is a lot nicer. In addition I took photos in various situations and did a blind test with my wife and between the s24 I'll try and the s25 ultra every single time she chose the s25 that's the better photo.

And I don't know what it is but I play Call of Duty mobile a lot and the graphics are just sharper and more detailed and it's just fantastic., I also enjoy the updated operating system visuals. And there are just things I am still finding all over the place that I like. Another small thing that nobody else has mentioned is the buttons on the side are much easier to press and it is just nice for me to click the button very easily.

I also agree on the sound. It does feel more rich like you said and also gets louder.

Another thing to mention is the fingerprint scanner is super accurate and covers a larger area. When it is recording your fingerprints it moves the circle around slightly all over and makes you scan it in that location. I didn't notice that on the s24. 

Also with the screen being brighter and sharper and clear there is another option in brightness settings that you can actually set even brighter and of course it warns you that it takes more battery usage but it's interesting to see it there.

So many people I know have the display very very Dim when they are using their phone but I have always been one that loves the brightness and the Vibrance of the colors.

I have the green color of the phone and I really like it. It is not something that I have had before.

Also just while I am talking about things I highly recommend the products that I got for it from amazon. I got a Torras magsafe clear case with stand and also a green wallet that goes with it. 

I had the s24 equivalence previously but the wallet was blue.

In addition I got the Torras tempered glass that you can just put the cover over your phone and then pull out a sheet drops the tempered glass screen protector onto your phone. It worked so perfect I didn't realize that it actually had put the screen protector on the phone and I looked to see what had gone wrong and then I actually looked very closer to my phone and with my finger now felt the edge of the screen protector on the phone. It was fantastic.

I have become a huge fan of that brand. I have used several of their cases and also they let me test a case. They actually emailed me and said that they wanted some testers for new products.

Comment,S25 Ultra,"It's crazy how there are so many arguments from both sides. All that ""not much of an upgrade"" and ""downgrade from the last model"" sound like they're too broke to upgrade and just trying to justify their last purchase was better.

I mean I am not really a ""phone"" enthusiastic but I've done my research and I think it's pretty good - especially editing the photos with the AI - you can literally remove any object unbelievably well unlike in iOS 16PM.

Not to be biased, I do think that removing Bluetooth feature is such a dumb move even if it's not used that much. It could've been something unique and exciting to play around with.

And I also like the square corners that made the previous models stand out and give them a premium look (I do know that the rounded corners are more comfortable).

And I saw some YT videos about durability being worse after prying them open - like how the heck uses that badly. If it's the reason for not upgrading, you might just be a stone age barbarian.

Now cameras, I do feel like I like the tone on the 16PM better - I think the ""warm"" tone gives it more cinematic and realistic feels to the photos. And if you did research, the stabilization in the iPhone video is definitely better.

What actually makes S25 Ultra cameras better than the iPhone is the zoom and the AI editing feature. Sometimes you just can't get people to move out of the way to take a nice photo. So either of them is just your preference in the end.

Though I do like the software on the Samsung better now with the one UI 7, I used to think that android OS is trash compared to the iOS.

One thing I'm scared of, is that sometimes new phone releases and then they got errors like infamous iPhone 13PM. But you can not avoid it if you don't wanna observe for a while and get behind on the latest trend.

In the end, there's no way S25 Ultra is not worth upgrading especially if you can trade in. On the side note, I use both brands and this is just my opinion. (I'm still waiting on my pre-order :<)",1,,0.066,0.172,0.9937

Comment,S25 Ultra,"I was wondering why the trade-in prices were so generous and why it now costs 5% of total MSRP to return it but I wonder no longer: this phone, albeit with rounded corners and a ""dumb"" S-pen, is the same as it was before! The 15% increase in processing power (and battery drain, mind you) plus some obscure camera improvements are just not enough to call this an upgrade. An update, maybe but, even if this was an S24 Ultra SE and they offered it to me for free, I would still forgo it until the next iteration, a truly new phone, with a brighter screen, Qualcomm's 3d Max fingerprint reader or some FACEID ripoff, Bluetooth put back into the Spen and a bigger battery that can justify putting such a power hungry processor. Also a better camera, with a bigger optical zoom range.¬†


I upgraded every phone from Galaxy s2 and this was the first time I sent both back because they're not different enough and my processor and battery are quick enough and hold enough charge for me to not be able to justify spending money on a WORSE device that lacks the features and access my current device offers.


I lose the ability to use the S-pen as a remote, can no longer access the engineering menu, android 15 has dumb restrictions that locked me out of all the internal apps I access to improve my experience with T-Mobile, in other words, if you're upgrading from, say, galaxy s10 or s20 then yeah, then it totally makes sense for you but not implementing a better fingerprint sensor and the fact that the iPhone users get a better, newer, much brighter, more energy efficient m14 panel whereas Samsung FLAGSHIP is still stuck with the older m13...

Comment,S25 Ultra,"Got my S25 plus (coral red) today and I'm returning. I felt like display and touch screen is a downgrade from my current S23 Ultra. I got this due to almost CAD 1000 trade in.
Comparatively,
My cons:
The black doesn't look like black on S25P
In very dark situations camera laser isn't capturing much detail (impractical and very less use, but given feature isn't working as a feature, lol)
The touchscreen while typing felt a little efforty than S23U, a 5 to 10% less smoother
My pros:
I liked the camera on S25P in lighting situations (not that S23U is any lesser)
In normal dark situations S25P is good, it's so much optimizing with the AI though

I recently traded in my Note 10 plus at T-Mobile for $500 so I'll be paying $20 a month for the 25 plus which is not that bad. The only reason I upgraded to the s25 Plus from the Note 10 plus was basically because the Note 10 plus have no more software updates, no more security updates.

I also get 8 years of updates versus the 4 years on s23. But I doubt I will have it that long but one never knows, right!?

 Best of all, I paid $250 plus after the trade-in. Can't beat that for the value and quality of this phone. 

It really is an upgrade from the vanilla s23 for those who are thinking about it but make sure you get an excellent price with trade-in. Otherwise, I would not have paid the full price but then again I never pay full price for any phone!",1,,0.05,0.158,0.9146

Comment,S25 Ultra,"Honestly, Samsung is getting greedy and taking its fans for granted. I'm a loyal Note user from the Note 4 to my current S23U. Note 9 seems like peak Samsung, Bluetooth pen, SD Card, MST for Samsung Pay, stereo speakers, IP68, headphone jack. Since the Note 9, we've been slowly losing features.

They tried taking the pen away with the S21U, the fact they took Bluetooth away means they'll eventually take the pen away, Samsung is so hellbent on becoming Apple that they'll lose me as a customer, and I'm one of the most loyal, powerusers of Samsung phones. 

If I wanted a lousy iPhone 11sssss pro max without pen, I would have bought the 16 Pro Max.

With the S Pen, I just click it and it takes a picture. I'm free to position my hand anywhere, and the S Pen is easy enough to hide especially in group photos. With the Watch5 Pro, I need to use the timer for it to be actually useful unless I want the picture to show me holding the watch.

Comment,S25 Ultra,"Apparently not confirmed by Samsung, but I did hear from some techtubers that they shoved the BT function of the S-Pen for weight reduction, and that based on their statistics (I have no clue where they got it), they saw that the Air Actions was not as used by people.

With this move, I'm already guessing that Samsung will NO longer even develop a FOLD that has a built-in S-Pen.  
WORSE -- they might just do an external S-PEN case on the next Ultra (just like how they did with the S21 Ultra and the FOLD series).

  
The only hope to get Air Actions on the S25 Ultra is for someone to check if the S-PEN PRO has some sort of connectivity to this. But as far as I've seen on this, even the SETTINGS menu for the Ultra lack this option (ie. Lacks EXTERNAL S-PEN Bluetooth Connectivity)

I am currently using S22 Ultra and am getting more and more worried about green line and bootloop issue with each passing day.

Comment,S25 Ultra,"I‚Äôm deeply disappointed with Samsung for removing the Bluetooth functionality from the S-Pen on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. For me, the S-Pen wasn‚Äôt just a feature; it was a game-changer. On solo trips, I never worried about asking someone to take my picture. I‚Äôd simply set my phone in the perfect spot, use the S-Pen to snap photos effortlessly, and even take multiple shots in different poses without constantly running back to check my phone.

The Galaxy Ultra series (formerly the Note series) has always been in a league of its own. It wasn‚Äôt just another phone; it was a brand, a symbol of excellence. Features like the S-Pen and the iconic boxy design made it stand out. These weren‚Äôt gimmicks‚Äîthey were the heart and soul of the Ultra experience.

Those who never used the S-Pen simply didn‚Äôt understand its value‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt meant for them. If they didn‚Äôt care about the S-Pen, they had the option of choosing the Plus (formerly S series) models. The Ultra, on the other hand, was for those of us who wanted the absolute best‚Äîthe best camera, the best performance, and the unparalleled versatility of the S-Pen.

Taking away such a defining feature feels like a step back, reducing the Ultra to just another premium phone rather than the powerhouse it was meant to be. Samsung, please don‚Äôt dilute what made the Ultra series so special.",2,,0.013,0.151,0.9883

As a Note user to the Ultra user I had dealt with the disappointment of having a more what felt like ""work"" phone vs ""girly"" phone. The Bluetooth pen was that point of difference. That couldn't live with out, physical reason. It's why I always ignored whatever Apple was doing, cause they never had this capability in such a user-friendly function. (stored inside and not on the side) 
Am I pished that if I want this function I have to buy one and hope that it's comparable and storable inside the s25 you bet. But would I be forced to cause of my use... Prob.¬†

Really hard to sing the praise of Samsung when this was a phsycial game changer... So many times I've said to someone with an Apple, ""don't worry, I'll use my pen to take that shot."" Now I can't... And now I have essentially an Iphone... Without magsafe...",2,,0.033,0.091,0.9623

So need not to test the Patience of Samsung Users by making Sensless Changes with nee Flagships as recently S25 Ultra has been removed with Bluetooth functionality.


Either through any updates or whatsever it took possibly to re-induce that feature otherwise the Consequences will be worse in coming years for Samsung to stay afoot in the Mobile World.

I wasn't going to get the 25u and instead get rhe 24u (I'll also miss the 10x optical of my 22u) I'll probably just get the 25u, upgrade to a remote shutter since I only use the remote feature with my tripod (the remote can just sit in the tripod bag) sure it limits my freedom and isn't always attached to the phone for those unique use cases it's probably the best option since the 25u battery will be so much better than the 22u. Even though they have the same battery the 25u is significantly more efficient.

I am pissed off. I wish I could change things, I wish more people were pissed off so we could boycott the 25u but thats just not realistic.

So yeah thats my 10p.",1,,0.074,0.085,0.5684

My review never posted (over 24 hours has elapsed since submitting it).

They removed one of the few distinct features it has, without adding anything new, didn't drop the price, didn't use the reclaimed space (presumably from dropping the S-Pen's charging coil) for more battery, anything.

I have noticed so far, I try use Gemini everyday for tasks just to speed them up and to get used to the whole AI revolution as it's here to stay, so I need to keep with it.


Battery lasts me a whole day and I still have around 50% spare, although I'm not on my phone doing intensive tasks during the day, just work chats, emails and note taking.


I actually forget about the S-Pen, it's not something I used on previous Samsung Note phones and I have no reason to start now, so it's not a big thing for me.


I haven't tried much with camera, I'll be using it for my wedding day this year a lot, but so far I love the quality of it for portrait and landscape shots.

Comment,S25 Ultra,"I‚Äôm deeply disappointed with Samsung for removing the Bluetooth functionality from the S-Pen on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. For me, the S-Pen wasn‚Äôt just a feature; it was a game-changer. On solo trips, I never worried about asking someone to take my picture. I‚Äôd simply set my phone in the perfect spot, use the S-Pen to snap photos effortlessly, and even take multiple shots in different poses without constantly running back to check my phone.

The Galaxy Ultra series (formerly the Note series) has always been in a league of its own. It wasn‚Äôt just another phone; it was a brand, a symbol of excellence. Features like the S-Pen and the iconic boxy design made it stand out. These weren‚Äôt gimmicks‚Äîthey were the heart and soul of the Ultra experience.

Those who never used the S-Pen simply didn‚Äôt understand its value‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt meant for them. If they didn‚Äôt care about the S-Pen, they had the option of choosing the Plus (formerly S series) models. The Ultra, on the other hand, was for those of us who wanted the absolute best‚Äîthe best camera, the best performance, and the unparalleled versatility of the S-Pen.

Taking away such a defining feature feels like a step back, reducing the Ultra to just another premium phone rather than the powerhouse it was meant to be. Samsung, please don‚Äôt dilute what made the Ultra series so special.

Though I really wanted to upgrade and I pre-ordered S25 for Ultra model but now I'm just going to pass it this year and stick to my S22 Ultra. Nice way to loose customers !! Well done Samsung !!",5,,0.018,0.11,0.9683

It's made me reconsider my decision. I wasn't going to get the 25u and instead get rhe 24u (I'll also miss the 10x optical of my 22u) I'll probably just get the 25u, upgrade to a remote shutter since I only use the remote feature with my tripod (the remote can just sit in the tripod bag) sure it limits my freedom and isn't always attached to the phone for those unique use cases it's probably the best option since the 25u battery will be so much better than the 22u.

Comment,S25 Ultra,"To clear up your apparent confusion. The tablet S Pens are entirely different from the one in a Galaxy S2x Ultra phone. The one in the phone is small enough to fit inside the phone. The tablet ones magnet to the outside. Apparently people didn't use the Bluetooth gesture features very much on the internal S Pen of the phone which led to them dropping Bluetooth support for S Pens entirely. That does mean your Tablets S Pen won't have Bluetooth functionality on it either, but I just now tested my Tab S6 pen on my S23 Ultra and it didn't work at all anyway. So you're not losing additional functionality if you have the tablet S Pen. It also means there will still be an S Pen in the S25 Ultra, but it won't have the underused ""flick your hand in different directions to change volume or track"" function. And it won't have the wireless shutter button functionality either. Which admittedly probably sucks for a relatively small handful of people.

Comment,S25 Ultra,"I could not agree more about Samsung screwing up the S Pen when they took away the bluetooth. That is what sold me on the Note 9 years ago and what caused me to look at the S25 ultra as a possible upgrade (until I found out they removed the reason I wanted to buy it). The bluetooth was wonderful for group/vacation photos. I am also not happy that they did not include the 45 watt charger. It is insane!!! Pay $1400 for a phone you can't charge unless you buy a charger... seriously!!! I have been loyal to Samsung for over 20 years but I think I may start looking at other ""flagships"" that are not taking away needed items/features and then nickel and diming people to get them back.

Personally I've never used a case on any phone but this is because I've  never really dropped a phone.

At about 3ft-5ft its been pretty fine through the years. I do hvae some sort of small back crack but nothing like the others whose whole screen or back is totally broken.

So it does come down on how mucb risj you are willing to take. When you are in bed or closer to the ground, having no case is absolutely fine.

But in thr worst case or unlucky scenario that your phone falls from a higher ground(or with greater velicity) and hits an edge, not having a case maybe expensive if your screen tets broken

The samsung(and the apples) i assume are tested heavily, even by some reviewers and creators.

For normal falls the phones are typically good. They do repeat the tests after so many times(which of course cracks the phone and even makes it stop working)

i use it with a special case, for the same reason as you state here, because i want to feel the phone, or at least the sides.

so this case is covering the back of the phone the top and the bottom leaving the sides totally uncovered, making the phone feel like it doesn't have a case.

been using it for some years like that and no problem.

dropped it a few times, no problem

Comment,S25 Ultra,"I'm the same way, I have s23 ultra and have been using it without a case for about 3 months now, so far so good. Except I was on break at work one day and I was outside sitting on the side of the building so I could smoke( I work at Walmart) so I'm sitting on the concrete Indian style you know and my phone is on my leg, I go to light my cigarette and as I'm doing that, I feel my phone start to slide off my leg, I could have caught it, but I figured it's a 2 inch drop, it'll be fine. Well it cracked the back glass it two opposite corners, not very big at all and really not even noticable unless you already know it's there, but it made me so mad lol plus to top it off, I hadn't even had the phone a full week yet. But anyway I hate most cases too, I keep ordering different ones constantly though hoping to find one I like, but it's hard bc I hate it being so bulky too and I like the slim feeling of it without a case, plus I like the lavender color of the back glass, but it's definitely a risk, I've ordered another case and if I don't like it, I'm just going to order the one I had for my s22 ultra bc I definitely liked it the best. I thought it was all over the other day though bc I had my phone in my hand and tried to open the car door with the same hand and I felt the phone fall out of my hand, instantly I'm like it's over now there's no way it's not cracked, but then a second later I realize I didn't hear it drop like at all, so I'm looking looking starting to think it's a glitch in the matrix, and then I notice it fell into the front pocket on my purse that was hanging on my arm....wheww close one...

Comment,S25 Ultra,"S25 Ultra is only a dud if you expected to upgrade from S24 Ultra to S25 Ultra. It's a beast, the only lack is the S-Pen's Bluetooth capability, the rest everything is better is some way.

If you have a S20, the S25 Ultra blows away every Pixel or Galaxy device you could think of in term of CPU/GPU performance, picture quality and overall smoothness of the UI.

People whining is only because they wanted more, I myself was letdown with rumors of S-Pen downgrade and only 12gb of ram coupled with ""only"" an m13 oled panel. The phone is still top of the line for Samsung and I had to replace my S23 Ultra. The S24 Ultra was already faster 30% on the CPU/GPU. Add on top the 30-40% of the S25 Ultra. It results into a massive CPU/GPU upgrade, let alone extra ram and CPU efficiency for extra battery (which is brand new compared to my beaten up S23U one). This is a no-brainer upgrade for me.

Go for the S25, stop reading threads of people saying it's garbage. It is not.

Comment,S25 Ultra,"The S25 series is definitely not a dud. The Ultras have basically been the best Android phones on the market for the last 3 years now, and Samsung has taken the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" approach with each new iteration. The phones are barely an upgrade from the last ones, this is true, but the previous ones were so damn good there's not a lot more they can do to improve it in a meaningful way. The S25 Ultra has the same battery size as the S24 Ultra, but the S24 Ultra already lasts all day on a single charge and is hard to run down over the course of an average user's day. The screen is the same quality, but the previous screen is already one of the best phone screens you'll ever get (ESPECIALLY with the amazing anti-glare coating). The cameras are virtually unchanged, but the previous cameras were already top-notch cameras that all but the most finicky of users could ever bemoan.

The point is that the S25 series, especially the Ultra, isn't gonna be a dud of a phone. The S24 Ultra was pretty much universally agreed to be the Android phone of the year, and the S25 is just a minor iteration on that. The only thing we've actually lost is the Bluetooth functionality in the S Pen, but this is otherwise every bit as fantastic a phone as the S24 Ultra was. You simply can't go wrong getting any of the Ultra phones within the last 3 years basically",10,,0.039,0.16,0.9893

Comment,S25,I had Pixel 8 for half a year... Then I got good offer for S24U and it's beast.

S24U is way smoother in most ways compared to Pixel nad it has so many features in UI including s-pen which is just great. From my experience clear android is good and also bad in some ways. For me I hated that Pixel for example doesn't support such a things like different ringtone for dual SIM which bothered me as I have sometimes oncall duty at work and couldn't recognize if I have private of work call... Some features on Pixel are cool no doubt but as complete feature pack I think that S24U is actually further... Customization is crazy.

Comment,S25 Ultra,"I went from the S8 -> S10 -> S22 Ultra -> Fold 4 -> iPhone 11 Pro Max -> Pixel 8 Pro -> Pixel 9 XL -> S25 Ultra.

The Pixel has better animations, haptics, and camera (compared to the S22 Ultra and Fold 4). It felt smoother, which I only realized after using a Pixel, as Samsung never had that same fluidity. I also love the form factor and shape of the Pixel. I‚Äôm one of those people who don‚Äôt prefer sharp-edged phones like the S22 Ultra. I loved the Pixel 9 XL design‚Äîit's the best camera I've ever used in a smartphone, and it captured some of the best photos I‚Äôve taken. I also love the ""Now Playing"" feature and wish Samsung had it.

However, there were too many basic bugs, and I switched back to Samsung for One UI. These are the bugs I experienced on the Pixel:

Alarms not going off: To snooze an alarm, I had to swipe an option on the screen instead of pressing a button.

Clipboard issues: The clipboard on Pixel was terrible. On my Pixel, it only remembered history for less than 24 hours, while Samsung phones keep it for weeks.

Missed alarms: Some alarms rang in silence, even with the volume at max. I never had this issue with Samsung.

Photos app is slow: Both my Pixels had a bug where my favorite photos reset after 3-4 months. This happened twice. Samsung‚Äôs Gallery app is underrated‚Äîit‚Äôs simple, fast, and doesn't require an internet connection.

Audio quality: Maybe it's a placebo, but music sounded clearer and punchier on my Samsung when using Bluetooth headphones, compared to the Pixel.

(PREFERENCE POINTS)

Preference: I prefer the secret folder on Samsung over Pixel‚Äôs private space.

Charging speed: Samsung phones generally charge faster than Pixel, which I like.

Flashlight: Samsung's flashlight allows you to control the brightness, whereas the Pixel stays at full brightness.

Call interface: I prefer Samsung‚Äôs implementation when receiving calls. The Pixel‚Äôs screen feels cluttered, and accepting or rejecting calls by swiping can be hit or miss.

Pre-order deals: Samsung offers great deals for pre-orders.

Sound quality: I love the sound of the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.",3,,0.038,0.105,0.979

Pixel 3: I can't find the threads about this, but I remember there was some major firmware update bug that caused phone calls to not work for quite a few months before it was fixed, because my friend had one of these and I was trying to help her troubleshoot and repair this.

Pixel 4: Same as above.

Pixel 4XL: [Another motherboard defect. Google extended the warranty by a year.](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/10169830?hl=en)

Pixel 9: Too new to say yet, but quick searches show a lot of similar complaints to past Pixels.

The worst part is that Stock Android enthusiasts and Google fanboys will defend the phone just because it's the ""stock"" and ""pure"" Android experience in comparison to other Android phones. This was moreso the case pre-One UI on Samsung, when TouchWiz and Samsung Experience genuinely came with a lot of useless bloatware and a relatively ugly user interface. Times have changed since then, and Samsung actually tends to be feature rich in useful things these days, and even sometimes gets Android features before Pixels do. And Pixels still do get bloatware in the form of pre-installed Google apps that can't be uninstalled if you prefer non-Google alternatives.

But the Pixel fans can just as bad as Linux or Apple fans in defending the thing and denying widespread issues. Even though the track records show ridiculous issues every generation.",4,,0.11,0.059,-0.9823

Simple stuff like NOT ALLOWING people to turn off mobile data when phone is locked cannot be done on a pixel, cant remove google search bar, cant remove at a glance and the terrible photos app vs samsung gallery which google photos asks you to backup your photos every 2 days unless you literally sign out of your google account in the photos app however if you do that then you loose alot of photo app features. These are some of the things I dislike alot.

I kinda feel like the whole Android vs Apple thing comes down to android treating people like admins not users. However with the Pixel I feel more like a user then an Admin.

Being a passionate photographer I think Google Photos is way worse than Samsung photo gallery. Less editing options, constant alerts if you don't back up your photos. If you do, the photos are uploaded to the cloud and sometimes I was unable to edit them. I was getting ""unable to download at the moment"" message.

Don't have floating window option for apps, I couldn't open 2 browser windows in split screen, the back gesture from the right side of the screen was hit and miss. Sometimes I had to do it 2-3 times to register.

Comment,S25,"Motorola and Google Pixel are the reason I have Samsung. 

I'd had various Motorola's until I had the one that you could pop various attachments onto magnetically.  Man, that was a neat phone. Then, one day, just out of warranty, I realized the internal battery is junk. I can't use it at all without the battery attachment.  They wouldn't help me at all, so I said screw Motorola.  I'll never own another.
 

Most of my other Motorola's had software issues, so I thought I'll get the Google Pixel, who knows software better than them. Just like Motorola,  what a great phone. Best sound and video I'd ever had. 

Also, just out of warranty, it shit. It had a software issue where it would say bluetooth keeps stopping and would pretty much lock the phone up. 

So one day I saw the Samsung S20FE on sale and I bought it. That was the first phone I had ever had that I didn't have to reset or do anything to. I used it until the S22+ came out.  They had some trade-in offer where they gave almost what I'd paid for it towards a S22+, and I've used it for over two trouble-free years. So now I wish I'd gotten one of the S24 deals after black friday but waited for the S25. 

TLDR, Samsung is just a more reliable phone.

Comment,S25,"I am in a similar boat. Got the iPhone 16 plus after years of using Android (I did use the first 3 iPhones) just to change it up. I can say that iOS is not user friendly, I understand people get used to it and it becomes second nature but the fact still stands that iOS is backwards and not user friendly.

One of the things I dislike the most is the lack of a universal back button/gesture. Also dislike you can't simply tap to place a cursor in between characters and the lack of a universal select all when highlighting a word. Another big one is the crappy notification system on iOS, the way it groups notifications and how it allows (or doesn't) you to dismiss them. Not mention all the glitches that I've encountered like apps freezing, keyboard  disappearing etc.

Android just does things in a more straight forward way and has much more intuitive user interface and experience. It feels like iOS has evolved much much slower and grandfathered in poor user experience choices so as to not alienate part of the user base or leadership is lazy and prefers legacy. Apple should just copy the best practices from Android like its notification system.

The only good things iOS has from most  important to least is FaceID, the MagSafe ecosystem, and FaceTime/iMessage. Google had something similar to iMessage but has kept abandoning apps and adopting new ones instead of consolidating them and sticking to a single app name like Google chat...multiple missed opportunities on their part.",40,,0.125,0.102,-0.716
Comment,S25,"Fair points but for me the biggest Apple bs of iOS is: file management, especially photos. iOS mindlessly throws every photo into one storage regardless of its type and where it is from, while Android separately stores photos by apps/folders automatically. It's such a pain to organize them and find a photo that you're looking for. Backing them up to a Windows PC is another disaster if you do this frequently. Their naming scheme is also weird af. Whether it is a photo you took, a random image downloaded from the internet, or a screenshot, they're all being named sth like ""IMG\_0000"". Once I had more than 9999 photos in my iPhone, it started to name photos like ""IMG\_0000 (1)"". What a freaking dumb way to handle file names. ü§¶",12,,0.134,0.061,-0.9325

Comment,S25,"> close all apps button

This is discouraged because it just causes more issues and battery usage. An app on the list has permission to be open by the operating system to complete tasks. Such as a podcast app waking up at night and downloading new episodes. Or an Adblock downloading new definitions. Otherwise, these tasks have to run when you launch the app, which is starting from scratch rather than resuming. 
Because of the silly trend of swiping all the apps away, Apple has actually had to program in the ability to have apps still open in the background and not break the processes because they incorrectly think it helps to OCD them all off the screen. They just run much less often than they could. 

> Keyboard sounds 

People leave those on?

> cursor placement

You can just grab the cursor and place it anywhere. If you tap it‚Äôll go to the end of the word but you can grab it and drop it.

The Lock Screen shows when the next alarm is.  Minor feature difference.

My takes on your points:

- Close all apps would be great agreed

- Keyboard: Whenever I was handed an Android phone from a friend or colleague to write something, everything was off. I was slow, always looking for things to find on em. Not saying it‚Äôs better than Android just saying it‚Äôs different, so probably that‚Äôs your problem too, just got to get used to it

- Keyboard sounds are indeed buggy but my phone is on silent constatly for years, so never hear them ever. Buggy or not they are annoying anyhow.

- Back gesture as in swiping the screen so it goes back a page? Never had a problem with that

- Cursor placement: you can use it by tapping the screen and holding it, a magnifier will come up and you can move it, or the spacebar mode yes, both methods work, no problems with either for me

- Alarm: I mean sure, sounds pointless, but sure they could add it

- email notif: If I want to read it completetly that is because I want to answer it. And for that I‚Äôd open it anyways. What do I get by reading it in the notification instead of the app? Idk, but sure they could add it

- Interface: i don‚Äôt know what you mean, on 120hz models it‚Äôs super fast, and Android still has the choppy scrolling problems on any phone even flagship Samsung ones, while on an iPhone if you scroll it scrolls smoothly

- Customization: are you familiar with the concept in marketing, where having less option actually get you more customers? For example at burger places, if you have 2 option you are rolling in orders, when there are 300 options people just stop caring because too many choices. I feel the same with my phone. I don‚Äôt WANT to customize it, give me a fix framework which I‚Äôll believe is the best the engineers could come up with, and I‚Äôll learn it and use it. Never had a thought of ‚Äúhmm wish I could customize this or that‚Äù. Just give it to me as is, and it‚Äôll be good. Of course, to each their own. All of my iPhone user friends say the same, ‚Äúwhy would I want to customize?‚Äù. It‚Äôs good as it is.",3,,0.038,0.16,0.9954

Also i have to mention that: it‚Äôs so annoying seeing notifications, on android you see them in the notification bar at the top consistently over all apps so i always know if i received a notifications, on ios on the other hand, if i miss the notification pop-up, i have to manually check if i have received notifications by swiping down top left or by going on home screen and checking for app icons if they have those little numbers indicating i got notifications. I feel like Apple don‚Äôt want us to see notifications:D

I have received salary and I didn‚Äôt know until I have opened the bank app to check, or haven‚Äôt responded to my gf for hours because I am not used to always check for notifications manually.

Btw, i have experienced every single thing you enumerated, especially that one with typing sound louder and quiet, i thought it might be a bug from my phone only :))

Also not having universal back gesture is a crime! And as you said, the swipe gesture to swipe is so inconsistent, i have to do it like 3 times sometimes for it to work.

Comment,S25 Ultra,"* **No ‚ÄúClose All Apps‚Äù Button:**¬†I miss having a quick way to close all background apps instantly.

\> Why do you even need that?

* **The Keyboard is Awful:**¬†Compared to SwiftKey on Android, the iPhone keyboard feels years behind. Even after downloading SwiftKey on iOS, it‚Äôs not the same - there‚Äôs no option to resize the keyboard, and in some apps, SwiftKey randomly disappears, leaving me stuck with the default iPhone keyboard.

\> I think it's mainly muscle memory. I switch regularly between my S24 ultra and 14 Pro max. And every time it takes some time to get used to it. It's mainly due to the formfactor of the iPhone.

* **Keyboard Sounds Are Buggy:**¬†Sometimes, the sound of keypresses is randomly louder or glitchy, which is extremely annoying.

\>keyboard sounds? My phone is almost always on silent mode.

* **Inconsistent Back Gesture:**¬†The back gesture on iPhone is not consistent across apps, and that‚Äôs frustrating.

\>This is an issue for sure!

* **Alarm:**¬†On Android, when I set an alarm, it shows me how many hours are left until it goes off. iPhone doesn‚Äôt have this feature, and I really miss it.

\>indeed, a handy feature.

* **Email Notifications:**¬†On Android, I can read an entire email from the notification bar. On iPhone, I can‚Äôt.

\>My opinion is that (lockscreen) notifications on iOS, though more cluttered, are way more visible then on android

* **Apple's Interface:**¬†It's great having good hardware, but what's the point if the User Interface is so frustratingly slow? I even enabled ""Reduce Motion"". I get it, the animations are smooth and cool, but the Reduce Motion feature should get rid of all of the animation steps to a setting that I searched for or clicked a shortcut to - and it doesn't. Also scrolling on iPhone is painfully slower when trying to move from the bottom of a page to the top compared to Android.

\>iOS appears to be slower than android. But if you for example open apps on android and iOS at the same time you will see that they open as fast or faster than on android. I find that navigation true my iPhone goes faster than on my S24 ultra. The latter ""feels"" faster because animations are quicker. But it's mainly a mind trick.

* **Customization:**¬†Most of you are probably tired of hearing this over and over again, but I got to say this. All those pixels, and I can't even change how many apps there are on my screen. My grandparents wouldn't care for sure, they wont even be able to see smaller icons, but I care. I would like to have more apps on my screen, smaller ones. I don't want to be limited, when there are better alternatives on the market. It's like buying an expensive car, but then you find out you can buy another one from a different brand, for the same price, which has a ton of more features, but they're both advertised as ""supercars"".

After moving from a Lumia 930 (Windows 10 Mobile) to an iPhone 6s (iOS 10.2.1), I was rather underwhelmed by how complicated and difficult to use, yet devoid of useful features, iOS is.

However, when it comes to the more up-to-date choice of Android vs iOS - iOS has pioneered many features that are useful in everyday life that are either not present on Android or are present in a much worse form.

Out of curiosity, I bought and use two ChromeOS-based devices and two Android-based devices, as well as some Google-compatible accessories (such as Nest Audio and Google Streamer 4K) that should work well together.

The GPS was HORRIBLE. I read that the iPhone modems were bad, but this GPS got me Seriously lost on multiple occasions. I drive around for work, so this was an absolute necessity of a phone.

That was the last straw, in addition to everything you said, above. The last LAST straw, was one day I took a selfie and it...mirrored it. I liked the selfie I took, but disliked the mirrored version. There was no way to prevent this, you had to select the picture and re-mirror it. I think this is an option, now, but at the time Apple did this with all selfies. It was such a case of 'you want this, you know you do, I don't care what you say.'

I hate Apple products. I was an early adopter, in 2003 with a Macbook for college. I had 2, and each one lasted 14 months. Different issues (hard drive, motherboard, battery.) The iPhone and iPods I had each lasted a year or so, before developing deal breaking faults. 

I was accused of being hard on devices. Since then, over the past 20 years, I have had 2 gaming laptops and a tower, each of which has lasted >6 years (and has never actually 'failed,' more so needed upgrading.)

I notice that most iOS users don't even try to use the shitty launcher interface and instead pull up the search bar and type to find and open apps. Same with the phone/contacts app. They are so hard to use that nobody uses them and instead just uses the keyboard to search.  

iOS users say things like ""I don't like Android because I don't want to spend time customizing things on my phone."" Meanwhile it takes 5 seconds to completely change your home screen on Android while on iOS you have to set aside an afternoon to sit and poke and hold 200 individual apps and slowly move them around one by one to clean up your home screen.

However, when I consider the other benefits I got from switching to iPhone, particularly with the s25 range being identical, for all intents and purposes, to the s24, I think that I'll be sticking with iPhone anyway for another generation.

The biggest pros I've found is that so far,

* even with the release of the iPhone 16, my 15 Pro Max doesn't feel old or out of date and even official accessories are still easy to get. Samsung phones I find accessories dry up almost instantly when the new models drop.
* when I trade in my iPhone, the Apple store will give me the trade in credit instore. I don't have to stress about sending it in after getting an estimate and 'hoping' that there aren't any issues, or reduction in credit from Samsung
* Seamless connection with my iPad pro. As cool as the fold was for a big screen, I find that I can just use my iPad Pro when I need  big screen and the ecosystem does a great job of syncing internet connection and files/photos.
* And super subjectively, I hate Samsung's poor level of customer service. Multiple issues with the fold that meant I was without a phone for between 1 - 3 weeks. The last time it happened the Pro Max was $300 off so I just bought it after dropping the fold 4 off for repair. Annoyingly I am now almost a week into waiting for Samsung to send a repair tech out for my fridge which has had the fridge door alarm sounding since Sunday morning and Friday is the soonest someone can 'look' at it, with a chance that they'll need to go an order a part anyway.

‚ÄúNo close all apps button‚Äù - the answer here is that you simply don‚Äôt need to close background apps. I never close them, after a few minutes the state is stored and it‚Äôs purged from memory so not using any resources.

Comment,S25,"Man, you come to apple, the company that BUILT itself on reducing features for the sake of dubious ""streamlining"", and want customization? Lol. The iphone has been so ""streamlined"" exactly because it has none. It's not a phone you ""buy"" and ""own"". It's not YOURS. It's the phone that Tim Cook LENDS you for 1.5k usd. You remember when microsoft switched from ""My Computer"", to ""This pc"" with windows 10, people asked why? The popular (and probably most accurate) answer was ""Because if you installed win10, this computer is not yours anymore"". Apple was built on this principle from the very start. It has one advantage, sure - iphones have a ""longer lifespan"", than most android phones. Even years later any iphone will work more or less the same as it was when you got it, unlike androids, that tend to get slower, the OS tends to bloat, so on and so forth. They achieved it by making like... 70% of the ""phone itself"", it's core, it's OS and inner workings, inaccessible. It ALLOWS you to make calls, messages or install SOME apps, if they come from a designated store. But other than that - it's not yours. It lives it's own life 80% of the time. Step to the left, step to the right - ""your"" phone is a brick, your warranty moot, go fck yourself. Apple is a literal epitome of ""brand enslavement"". You're not supposed to customize it. The corp has a designated department that will decide for you how your phone looks and works.

You say this phone will be perfect for your grandparents? It's because old people are the target audience. Well, not on the surface, but if you think about it. Let me reiterate: it's aimed at people with ""tech-savvy"" level of the elderly. The main aim in it's design is to work (more or less) smoothly even in the hands of a complete braindead.

Same as you with inconsistent back gesture... one app (even a paid one!) Doesn't allow you to go back to the main manu unless to swip (not sure if up or down anymore... always forget it) on the bottom side but not directly on the edge of the screen but like 5cm in. And no you don't get a cycling back button that would have more than enough space. And no nobody tells you how you get to the main menu!!!!!

Only unlock the screen by pressing the one button on the screen instead of swiping over it or doing anything else...

Opening the ""open apps"" view is also a pain. Sometimes the swip gesture works. Sometimes not...

Getting images into an app from my phone.... first upload the image to my nas, then copy from nas to iPad. But no you can't just copy it directly into the gallery. First copy it in some random folder somewhere hidden in that device. Then having the folder and gallery open in parallel and drag and drop it WTF?!?!? And then... just then can I open/import the image in the app.... because fuck me I guess...

Cloud sync... pain to get it disabled everywhere. Backstory: i got the iPad from a family member who also had one and wanted to share some paid apps. So he logged in on that one to do so. When I got it I disabled all the syncing stuff I could find because I don't need anything beeing backed up or saved at Apple.... and my kids will get it so I set up some of the display time settings, restricting app usage and so on. Just to get notified that the iPad from my family member ALSO has all that settings enabled now. I searched through the settings and find one that should disable the syncing of those. But I couldn't do that on mine. It just wasn't toggleable. But was on his... grrrrrr

And as an additional to those app restrictions. I set a limit of 15min for some apps. After that time you can just click ""add some more time"" or ""disabled for today"" WITHOUT pin or any other security measures. But to change those settings i would need one. Like why do you even give me the option to limit stuff if my kid can just ignore it????

Apple's task management has generally been better than Android's since forever, but that comes at a cost of not being able to let background apps run for as long as you'd like. They're pretty strict about it, which can be limiting. 

The benefit of that approach is that a Close All Apps button isn't needed, and in fact is even a poor choice for their memory and task management model.

Comment,S25,"I have never had an iPhone. 

I always seem to find something annoying about it that turned me completely off. 

Even when I had to use an iPad for work, I got so annoyed with it. Everything about how they design the OS just didn't make sense. If you prefer something a different way, Apple's answer is basically, this is how we think it's best used. Adapt to it. And I can't accept that. 

Until now, when my parents need my help with their passed down iPhones from my sister, I still find myself incredibly annoyed at their interface. 

But the biggest issue I have about Apple is their blatant abuse of their customers and maximising profit as much as possible from their fan base. 

Lightning for devices claiming better performance. Then suddenly type c on one end and lightning on the other. Then suddenly type c on both ends is better for ipads. But not iPhones. 

Then type c for iPhones as well. Are their charging tech any worse now? It was slow charging before, it's still slow now. 

Removing the charger from the box claiming environmental reasons and then asking you to pay premium to buy it separately when 90% of the other manufacturers use a universal standard type c. Which is better for the environment?

Heck it's even challenging to find a compatible card reader. Want it to work perfectly? Buy the one they sell at a premium. I have never had an android phone fail to work with any card reader.

The iPhone just wouldn't open it. Useless piece of crap. 

Both daughters had iPhones years ago when the 5 came out. When they needed upgrading, I hated having to sort crap out on them so tried to get them to change to android. Neither were interested cos it's a status thing.... Until I mentioned that I could plug memory cards in to my phone to add more memory. Eldest immediately asked for an android.

I‚Äôll skip over some cause plenty people of said it but ugh yes you can customize you‚Äôre Home Screen. I‚Äôll give you this was mostly with ios18 last year, but yeah you can at the time you posted this. 

Also hate the argument some make about android being the tech persons or IT phone choice. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs the choice of that person.

As a professional in cybersecurity, I couldnt care less of the personalization and niche use cases and appreciate the reliable work horse it‚Äôs meant to be along with the security infrastructure that is needed in my industry. Yes android can be a red team tool, a pro will not be doing that with their personal phone, just as we shouldn‚Äôt use our personal pcs for work either. 

The platforms are mature and the difference are all just personal preference at this point because both will do what most need and want. This isn‚Äôt 2012, stop with the fanboying about a phone and just get the expensive rectangle that works for you at the price you‚Äôre willing to pay for it.

You‚Äôre not supposed to close your apps, you close them only in case they‚Äôre unresponsive, the os manages them all for you.

Comment,S25,"I've worked for a cellular company for just over 20 years. Not in sales or technology, but I've seen a lot of changes over the years. I've used Android consistently since it was introduced, and am currently using a Z Fold 5. 

iPhone was a big deal from day one, but they've always been extremely restrictive. When I was downloading and using ringtones, my iPhone friends were asking how I did it. When I was using my fingerprint to unlock my phone, my iPhone friends were very interested. The same goes for face recognition and many other features. Apple had the first smart phone, but Android was first with a lot of features. When Apple finally got those features and made a big deal out of them, Android users laughed because we'd been using them for years.

Apple restricts just about everything on their devices and leaves little to no room for personalization. When a new model comes out, it's the same as the previous one but with a different number and a higher price tag, yet iSheep run to get them. I can also buy a charger from literally anywhere. But if iPhone users don't buy one from Apple, their charging ability is throttled. 

And what about when you have an issue? I can go online, submit a claim, and have a new device the next day. iPhone users have to make an appointment at a store, take their phone in, wait for someone to attempt a repair, and get handed either the same device back or a refurbished one. I had a Z Fold 3, and they were out of stock, so it was replaced with a new Z Fold 4. I got my Z Fold 5 the same way.

Cursor Placement: Yes if you click on a word it puts it at the beginning of a word but if you ‚Äúlong press‚Äù it brings up a magnifying glass and you can position it where you want fairly quickly. 

Alarm: if you set up a sleep schedule in Apple Health it tells you when the alarm will go off on the lock screen.

Comment,S25,"I did move from an iPhone to Galaxy, but it was many years ago. I'll try to answer your questions as best I can.

I have never looked back. Android offers so much more customizability, and there are so many manufacturers that use Android that you're going to be able to find a phone to fit your needs, whatever they may be.

I'm don't think facetime works, but I'm pretty sure iMessage now has RCS integration so Androids and iOS phones can communicate from, for example, Google Messages to iMessages now without resorting to 30 year old SMS technology.

The features were more than enough to make up for leaving Apple. And the camera, in my opinion, is ridiculously good. In my S23U anyway. 100x zoom is crazy, and it takes great pictures.

I think only you can answer this question. Are you ready for a switch, for something new? Can you get used to a whole need OS and ecosystem? The biggest change will be moving from iOS to a new OS. It's a totally different beast.",21,,0.03,0.144,0.9781

Had the iphone 11 pro max and was going to upgrade to the iphone 14 pro max but just felt like it was the same phone. Wanted something different so i tried the s23U and tbh i love it. 

It sucked not having imessage initially but they have since added RCS to iphone in a recent update which is androids version of imessage. You can also facetime with iphone users via a link they send to you. 

I would highly suggest giving it a shot. The customization available to you on android is a big plus. Everytime i see another android user the home screen looks completely different from mine/others. Its cool because everyones looks unique whereas iphone they all look relatively similar if not the same with minor adjustments.

Comment,S25,"I get that feeling of wanting to try something new because thats where I'm at currently. My last 5 phones have been with Samsung (note 8, s20, s21u, s22u, s24+) but the only reason I've sticked with Samsung is because all around, they put out an amazing phone.

They're not perfect and they used to be the one that had all these features others got rid of, but they too moved in that direction. It may be features that most don't care about like sd cards or 3.5mm jack, but its what used to set them apart. 

I've wanted to try out Sony's phone but I don't care for pictures and since the OS isn't as good, I haven't jumped and while Pixel has gotten much better, I think they're too pricey for what they offer. Samsung is also pricey as well and no phone should cost the going rate now, but trade in deals really have made it much less expensive.

If you're really into the IOS ecosystem, then Samsung or andriod might not be for you. I love android because customization is important to me and I don't like IOS. So I know Apple isn't for me. If you really want to try something different though, I've heard that the Pixel is an excellent transition for apple users to andriod.

Comment,S25,"One thing I learned about Androids vs IOS is in the US, the carriers have a lot of say as far as bloatware and available features on android phones vs IOS.  RCS is still new and not all carriers have implemented it so that it works across different carriers, this will lead to inconsistency in your messaging app.  If you buy an unlocked Android you won‚Äôt even get HD voice with ATT, which makes the call quality absolute trash.  He‚Äôll, at one point I couldn‚Äôt even get visual voicemail, meaning I had to phone in to listen to my messages like it was 2002.  

In short, Android does handle notifications and everyday tasks like saving files and organizing better than IOS in my opinion, but as far as ease of communicating, especially with other IOS devices, iPhone is the way to go.

Comment,S25,"I recently broke my iPhone and I'm using a Motorola temporarily. I have had iPhone since the first version. Android is insanely annoying but there are some little differences that can be cool. First and foremost the accuracy of the touch screen is wildly better on an iPhone. Something else that I miss that this phone doesn't have is the feature where you touch the top of an iPhone and it scrolls all the way back to the top. You will never understand how useful that is until you switch. This phone does not sync to my Apple watch my MacBook my iMac my homepod etc. which can be extremely inconvenient. And 99% of people that I interact with friends and family all have iPhones so like just texting. Is different even though they've released RCs for iPhone it's not the same. You can customize the way apps work and how they use battery a lot more on this phone. Emojis are actually cooler on this phone in my opinion because they're animated. Something I'm not sure whether I like or dislike is the customization within the settings when you open one setting you end up going down a rabbit hole because there are so many different things you can configure. In one sense it's neat and another sense is very overwhelming. This phone also has in the same tray as the SIM card a slot for an micro SD card. Which is fantastic for storage purposes. I also do hate every single ringtone and text tone that comes with this Android. I miss all of my ringtones that I had made custom on iPhone and also you can't transfer anything you've downloaded or paid for through the app store which is a big pain. And while this phone uses Google services throughout which is great for connecting to all my Google I prefer it would sink for my Apple devices since I have physical Apple devices and most of my Google stuff is just digital except for my Google hub. That's another thing the apps for this phone like the text messaging and phone apps are actually Google apps and the functionality is sometimes sketchy. Like I don't understand why Motorola just doesn't have a standard text messaging app that comes with the phone why it has to be a Google one I don't know.

Comment,S25,"Smart Switch is helpful in getting your contacts over and the operating system will take some getting use to, but is much better in my opinion. Also the Android universe is much larger across multiple brands and devices, there's so much more opportunity for collaboration (take Google as a Prime example). Apple is really a marketing gimmick that tries to force you into their monopoly.

Comment,S25 Ultra,"From October to last days of January, I was using s23 ultra. before that I was using 15 pro max. Now I use 16 pro max.  
Experience has been quite good. One hand operation is a god send. Good lock was pretty amazing. But Samsung always had a problem with keeping focus, and it showed.   
Without going into details I can say this: they put a really neat niche feature and then forget about it and drop support. For instance one hand operations plus had a way to send cropped photos with just one swipe but they killed it in an update(had to install an apk to get it back) and they are putting the feature back into another app which is way slower.

I didn't really miss either. I use whatsapp. Only reason to pick Imessage over the other apps is that it has e2e encryption, which whatsapp has.

Camera was... okay. In app photo taking was atrocious whether because of shutter speed or the lack of optimization for in app camera, i don't know. When I took a photo in an app, i would have to keep the phone still for good 1-2 seconds to get it right, which I took granted with an iPhone.  
  
If you like to play emulation games Samsung is the winner no contest.

Gallery app compared to apple is not good at all. OCR (search by in photo text) was not working reliably meanwhile in an iPhone it was so much easier to search for photos in general (OCR is top notch)

Navigating the phone is way better ergonomically in a Samsung. One handed usage is way easier. Keyboard experience is way better, but Microsoft swiftkey is pretty good on both of them.

**If you have apple watch along with an iPhone and you use the watch a lot, I wouldn't switch**. That's the reason why I switched back. Samsung watches are just not at that level. 

**If you would only use the phone by itself, I would switch**. By itself Samsung Ultra has the best experience in a smartphone. Battery is good, charging is way faster than an iPhone, and if you have issues, there is always a workaround while that's not the case in an iPhone.",3,,0.053,0.187,0.9957

If you are considering switching I'd highly recommend coming to Samsung first over most other android options. In my opinion, samsung is the only manufacturer that offers an ecosystem as close to apple.

I want to tell my phone what to do.

I do not want it to force me to use certain apps or do things a certain way.

Apple want to curate an experience for their customers.  

Android lets you do whatever you want...  

Everything is more customizable.  Your desktop is whatever you want it to be.  Don't like the stock one?  Use Nova Launcher or any other one.

Want to send a file to someone?  Pick any one of the dozens of apps to do it, Samsung has it's own version of Airdrop called Quick Share.

For every Apple feature or app.  Android has 10..

Apps are cheaper and less adds are run.  Apple takes a huge cut of the devs profits so they make it up with higher prices and more adds.

Samsung has Secure Folder for their flagships.  Basically turns your 1 phone into 2.  

One side for work and one for everyday use.  Secure folder is an encrypted container on your device that has it's own contact list and gallery.  A fresh install.  It's a great feature for anyone that has to deal with sensitive information.

Apple sells you the phone they want you to use.  

Android phones you can pick the features that you want and the price point you want to pay.

There are phones with amazing cameras, there are gaming phone.  You name it and there is an Android device that will let you focus on what you really want in a phone.  Not what you are told you want...

Samsung has an amazing app called Smart Switch.  With the scan of a QR code it can transfer all you iPhone data over.  Simple and easy.

Comment,S25 Ultra,"That‚Äôs a loaded question, I personally have gone from iOS to Android back to iOS back to Android for years I can never make my mind up because they‚Äôre both great in their own way. If you break your wants and needs down in to categories it might help. I think this year Apple and Samsung both have Amazing powerful phones on the hardware side of it and there isn‚Äôt much in it these days. Yes both company‚Äôs will be better than each other in certain areas like cameras, battery life, screen tech etc etc but I personally think this year is all about software. Take customisation out of the equation because that‚Äôs not here or there. Yes Android has better customisation than Apple but that shouldn‚Äôt be a focus point for a comparison in my eyes because how many times are you going to change your Wall paper, move your icons around just to name a few. Maybe look up iso18 vs one ui 7 and see what you think you‚Äôd prefer but again they are both great platforms that both better each other in certain areas I personally like both platforms I think that both companies have done Amazing jobs. I was on the s24 ultra last year then switched to the iPhone which I‚Äôm currently on an iPhone 15pro max and I have pre ordered the s25 ultra because Android will suit my needs for what I want out of a smartphone like Samsung dex as an example and the google ecosystem as I have a google os tv and google smart assistant around my house. Air drop doesn‚Äôt interest me neither does face time or iMessage because I have no need for them just to name a few but in the uk  green and blue bubbles are not really an issue and I think it a silly argument about iMessage or rcs or sms. Tech moves daily there are always work arounds for every solution and if someone really wanted to message me and talk then blue and green bubbles shouldn‚Äôt be an issue WhatsApp, Facebook messenger, google messages, iMessages at the end of the day there are just a way to communicate with other people and that‚Äôs what primarily a phone is made for. but that‚Äôs my requirements either one is different.

Comment,S25,"How has the experience been?

\- Switching is super easy, but there is a lot of house keeping you'll have to do to remove some of the bloat on the phone. 

\- Setting up GoodLock and customizing your phone is a big part of why I love Samsung/android. Maybe look  into some setups on Youtube or something and see if the customization is worth it/something that interests you. 

\- Battery life is significantly better; I had my s10+ for 4/5 years before it was dead, I can go about 1.5-2 days without charging my s24U. The charging options are also better with USB-C and their low wattage charging stands. 

Do you miss iMessage or FaceTime?

Yes. As a person in their late 20's and in the US I get constant shit for messing up group chats, green messages, etc. Plus side, is it's not a bad way to screen dates if they flat out refuse to message someone with green texts. I get around facetime by using googles version/snapchats. 

Are the Samsung features (like camera, customization, etc.) enough to make up for leaving Apple?

\- Features are awesome. Camera is great, the removal tool for AI is useful. The summarize article functionality with AI is also great. Best feature they have that isn't marketed nearly enough is the anti-reflection screens; Using a phone in bright sunlight is a breeze I can't imagine what it would be like to go back. 

Would you recommend switching, or should I just stick with the iPhone since I‚Äôm so used to it?

\- Honestly if iMessage and Facetime are the biggest hang up, then I wouldn't. If your group chats are in whatsapp then it would be fine, but otherwise it's a pain. I absolutely love my s24u and the boxy shape, but am probably going to swap to the new iPhone when it comes out later this year.",1,,0.057,0.212,0.9965

- if you like customization, Samsung is 100x better than apple. No competition.

- universal back gesture on android is AMAZING!!! SO MUCH BETTER THAN IPHONE. 
- iPhone face ID and just general animations are smoother. Raise to wake on iPhone is miles ahead of Samsung. But finger print reader on Samsung is awesome.

You should definitely make the switch to Android, but you don't have to go for Samsung at all tbh, there are great phones out there from different brands that you can go for, so I suggest you look at other phones as well, not only Samsung to find what matches your usage best.

Also, Samsung will probably put a time limit on when your credit can be redeemed without telling you (I was meant to have a ¬£20 voucher for the issues I had with my order of the Galaxy Ring, and that's just mysteriously disappeared without me ever using it even though it didn't have an expiration date on it like other vouchers do).

Comment,S25,"Man I thought I was getting crazy, but Samsung payment is broken.  
I want to upgrade my S22U because the battery is crap (otherwise the telephoto doesn't seem that much better and I'm let down by the S-Pen).

I have been trying to buy for 10 days, my payments always get refused. I contacted support who told me to try at different hours / with different setups because the website was busy with pre-orders. I tried with 4 different cards from 3 different banks, a PC, a Mac, a phone, on Firefox, Chrome and the app, nothing works. Every day the cart has different offers and discount for some reason. My Samsung points got locked in an unfilled order. I also tried financing by 3x in credit card, payment always ""fails"" after I validate the payment on my banks app, telling me to retry with another payment. (Note that since I return my S22 in Europe I don't have access to Paypal payment).

I contacted support again who told me I was blocked because I tried more than 20 transactions (wtf you told me to try again and more??). So I had to wait 72 hours so they close my transaction. They gave me a discount because pre-order would expire after the wait. I tried again, still doesn't work.

I really want to upgrade to get more battery life before an upcoming trip, I tried other brands before and didn't find anything as reliable as OneUI, but now I start to feel I don't want to give them my money, but I don't find an alternative.",2,,0.085,0.07,-0.6546

Marketing is targeted. Based on your identified purchasing motivation you were identified to not likely purchase a new phone so close to your last purchase. 

Now that your device is a bit older, data suggests you are more likely, even if not certainly, to consider an upgrade this cycle. Even if you do not make a purchase this cycle the marketing will begin cementing the age of your device and its lesser capabilities to increase likelihood for future gens.

With the S24U, there were no s-pen tips included. And now removing a feature that stood out. With S26U, I would hate to see having to spend another $150 on an external pen and specific case just so that I could carry it with like the S20 and S21U.

Comment,S25 Ultra,"I felt that every single year. Galaxy S10+ its the last great Samsung phone. When I bought, it came with: OTG adapter, AKG earphones, 1.5m cable with black piano on the tips, and a charger with black piano too, thin plastic case. The phone itself had: heartrate and o2 in blood sensor, headphone jack, micro SD, small camera bump, the ""3D touch vibration"" on thr bottom, dual selfie camera for depth.

Than, I bought a Note 20 Ultra: worst quality charger (wich caught fire recently), smaller and worse quality cable, no plastic case, no OTG. In the phone, removed the headphone jack, HR sensor, GIANT camera bump, the ""3D touch press"".

And nowadays, you are always behind the competition. No Micro SD, no headphone jack, no HR sensor, no slim design without bump, no charger, no headphone, no case, and it has price hikes.

The S24 and S25 are the same phone as mine physically so, since they went from 2 years to 4 years of OS updates starting at S21, and then 7 starting at the S24 (figures that I missed that guarantee by a mere year) there really is no reason for me to upgrade until the phone is close to death.

It was nice to see them bring the s pen back with the silo in 2022 but of course that was tainted by the terrible chip that Samsung fabricated. 

S23 ultra had some redemption though because you had the excellent chip. But then the next year they removed 10 times optical in the next year they remove Bluetooth s pen and we don't get any increase in battery or storage or RAM. 

In fairness pixels had a weak ear in this department as well as they increase their price a hundred bucks on each model for the second year in a row and had no corresponding storage bump. 

I feel like one plus is the only North American option that's coming to play this year, maybe outside Motorola in the budget or flippable space",1,,0.076,0.116,0.7371

Comment,S25,"They will resell it all as a killer feature in S30 or sth, lol. That's why I'm sticking to my S20.

But from S23 forward samsung's arrow firmly stuck on mimicking apple and stagnating. Removing, adding, then removing and then adding again the same features, and charging full-price every time.

It's really beyond me how samsung can't realize, that a lot of people went to them in the first place because they DIDN'T WANT apple. What should we do for our client base? Right! Start copying apple! In everything! That'll surely rack up our sales! Apple hamsters will come to us too right?!

Ffs. The removal of SDs in S21 was the start of a downward spiral. Literal betrayal, you can say. You know this moment when you see the person, a character in the movie, etc, they do/say ONE SINGLE THING, and you realize immediately - they sold out.

Comment,S25 Ultra,"I posted this as a separate thread but for those who still need information here it is.


S25 Ultra S Pen Q&A for those who need information with regards to AIR ACTIONS, Air Command, Enable other S Pen, Using S Pen Pro, etc.



Q: What changed with the S25 Ultra's S Pen?
A: Samsung removed the Bluetooth Low Energy Charging Module (BTLE IC) and Gyroscope Sensors inside the S Pen, thus losing the AIR ACTIONS functionality.




Q: What is Air Actions?
A: Air Actions is a set of gesture-based bluetooth commands from the S Pen that allows the phone to be controlled to perform different functions (such as opening the camera app, changing music, changing presentation slides, etc.)




Q: What is the difference between Air Actions and Air Command?
A: Air Actions is gesture and requires bluetooth to function (ie a function that requires an internal battery)

Air Command on the other hand is a menu that brings out a suite of productivity apps oriented for the S Pen experience. This menu is brought up when the S pen is brought near the screen and the pen button is pressed. This does NOT require the S Pen to have a battery.




Q: If the S25 Ultra S Pen doesn't have Air Actions, can I use other styluses that have bluetooth functionality to access those functions?
A: No. The S25 Ultra itself lacks the BTLE IC that is required for Air Actions to work. So using any other S Pens (S Pen Pro, Tab Ultra native S Pen, etc.) will not give you Air Actions.




Q: What happens when I try to connect the S Pen Pro to the S25 Ultra? Will it work?
A: If the S Pen Pro is put into pairing mode, the S25 Ultra DOES NOT recognize it. It can still write on the S25 Ultra but it cannot perform Air Actions.
The phone also lacks the ""CONNECT OTHER S PENS"" in its three-dot menu, proving that Samsung removed the necessary hardware for Air Actions to be used.

SUMMARY: S PEN PRO can write on the S25 Ultra, but it cannot perform Air Actions.




Q: Will an S24 S23 or S22 S Pen work with the S25 Ultra?
A: It will work for WRITING but it will not do Air Actions.




Q: What's the purpose of the ""ENABLE USE OF OTHER S PENS"" in the menu?
A: It is to allow the use of other S PENs for writing, when the original S Pen is stowed inside a device.

Example: If you have a Tab S10 Ultra and an S25 Ultra, you can use the Tab S10 Ultra S Pen to write on the S25 Ultra, even if the S25's S Pen is tucked inside the device.

If this feature is turned off, the digitizer panel of the screen is by default in the OFF state, until the phone's S Pen is removed from its storage compartment.




Q: Does ""ENABLE USE OF OTHER S PENS"" allow AIR ACTIONS to be activated?
A: No.


Samsung's website for the S25 Ultra explicitly says that Air Actions is not supported by the device.

If you are looking for a device that supports AIR ACTIONS on the S Pens these would be the following:

Note 10 Series
Note 20 Series
S21 Ultra
S22 Ultra
S23 Ultra
S24 Ultra
Z Fold 3
Z Fold 4
Z Fold 5
Z Fold 6
Tab S6 Series
Tab S7 Series
Tab S8 Series
Tab S9 Series
Tab S10 Series

These devices come with a bluetooth-enabled S Pen by default *the exception is the S21 Ultra and the Fold series which require a separate S PEN PRO to access the Air Actions functions.

Comment,S25,"I miss a lot of things about current smartphones that I've come to appreciate over the last 20 years. And if you take the Samsung S25 as an example, this phone basically has nothing new to offer, virtually nothing at all. Yes, the CPU is now even more bored and has even less to do (because it has simply become slightly faster), you need an even stronger microscope to be able to perceive the more pixels on the display at all, and so on and so forth.

Ultimately, these are all ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù that are largely due to the normal development of components. At the same time, more and more features are being cut. Example with Bluetooth and camera release. A feature that I have really come to appreciate.

The manufacturing costs are falling from year to year because the more and more integrated components are also becoming cheaper and cheaper. At the same time, development costs are also falling dramatically because ultimately nothing new comes along (AI apps are nothing new, apps generally count for nothing in hardware). And yet prices continue to rise in order to make even more profit.

Comment,S25,"The problem is they just view it as too niche of the product. The S10e didn't sell well so they replaced it with the S10 lite and eventually the FE series 

iPhone mini users only accounted for less than 5% of the market. Although iPhone SE users are also using a small phone. 

I agree I wish they would do it but because the market is so small they have to order displays and build chassis's that do not have the economy of scale of 6.8 in. 

So it's actually cheaper for them to make the budget phone 6.8 in because then they can use the same orders from Samsung display to gain a cost benefit and all of the chassis are using the same manufacturing process. 

That's why Apple won't make an iPhone mini for the SE model anymore and they're going to just use a 6.1 inch.

Comment,S25 Ultra,"I haven't found a way to do it on my S24 Ultra if there even is a way but I think it would be cool to have different home screen setups based off of different Modes. I know we can have different wallpapers but it would be cool if the apps could be completely different too. On my iPhone for the Work Focus Mode I had ""invisible"" widgets and had a few apps on the lower part of the screen which were delivery apps, Teams, Slack, Gmail for my work account, and some other apps I can't remember anymore. I posted this on Threads and apparently it was a niche thing that people on Threads didn't seem to care about but I feel like it could help me be a bit more productive since I would be able to hide all the social media and texting apps. An extra feature that iOS had related to this was it could turn on a Focus Mode based off a location you choose and obviously it could set all the apps and everything too. I had one for the gym which set the background to a random orange gradient that iOS had, the ""icon"" for the focus more was the Fire emoji/icon, and the apps on the screen were various workout apps and that was it.

For me, that feature was really used a lot and even though it seemed small or simple, it really did make a big difference in my day to day. If anyone knows of a way to do with OneUI's launcher, please let me know! I know there's apparently another launcher than can do similar but I really like OneUI.

‚óèSomething like facetime. Not for the samsung phones only. It should be available for all android phones atleast android 11+. Google can integrate such app with an update. But the important things is to have an great compression for both video and audio quality. Honestly, one and only thing i am jealous of apples.


‚óèBetter sound assistant integration. Yes bixby is there and yes google assistant is also there and more capable than siri atm. But it's not integrated well enough that i don't even use it. They need to clear the stanby listening issue and give it a face-lift aswell.


‚óè I hate the idea of my fullscreen being distributed but... faceid is much more convenient than fingertips scanners, no matter where you place it. So there is already a selfie camera punch in the screen, and i also know there are cameras under screen while screen is also working in that part. I am not talking about an punch. And i know it's not a good look. But if they could add a second rear camera behind the screen for depth information and bla bla... You get the idea. But i don't want any half baked feature, i would like to see it well thought out and well integrated. Yeah that would be cool asf, sorry dynamic island just sucks wouldn't buy a phone with that shit ever.


‚óèMaybe samsung's own cloud services could be good. The problem with samsung is the duality of google and samsung services, like samsung pass, like bixby... Ofcourse it's great to have options but if samsung wants me on their ecosystem than they should provide one. Now my whatsapp back up won't be restored in google drive but in onedrive? But my messaging app backs up at google one? But my gallery app suggest me backing up at onedrive? No, if you want me to use your services, you need to provide them all in one place.

That said, any phone that supports wireless charging has plenty of case options to add the magnetic element. Magsafe is still possible through 3rd parties. (Just check reviews if you have a model with an S-pen!! Some of the magnets interfere with the S-pen)

Since apple and Samsung have opposite charging on watches, it is difficult to find 3-in-1 charging stations for buds/watch/phone. They all seem to be designed for apple, which is fine and works for everything except the watch, on the samsung side. Once magsafe is fully integrated as standard I would hope to see more options for wireless charging stations.

Besides that, I really don't find anything lacking from Samsung at the moment. I have the S24U and I'm thrilled with it. It seems to have all of the best things from the previous 3 generations of phones smooshed into one package, with a sprinkling of new features, some of which are genuinely really useful to have.

Comment,S25 Ultra,"One word: NO. There's a reason these phones get 7 years of updates now. Saying as S20 Ultra user, who dont even feel the s24 is faster than the S20 for my activities. 

I don't see any reasonable reason to upgrade your phone unless your phone is too slow/died or you just want a newer one and have extra money for it. which is great of course.

There is nothing really new or exiting in the recent years, and as s20 ultra user, I dont see how s25 is a most-have upgrade

So what we have here? Speed- THE SAME. Camera? The specs on the cameras are practically identical to the s22 according to gsmarena. I doubt it would be much better. Battery- The SAME. Replace it if its too old. Don't think there is a huge difference in battery life despite the new CPU. So why would someone spend 1000$ ? for what? For little bit more hours of use in terms of battery life + little bit better camera? It's just for ""new"". And its also fine of course if that what people want , they can afford it, and that what makes them happy. Totally support.

But we are totally done with these days when your S1/S2/S3 were outdated so fast and barely survived after 2-3 years, and really good technologies were presented, as well as much better speed and user experience. And every new processor REALLY made a big difference. Today, good phone are still RELEVANT and can least for 5+ years. Even the S20.

And that is why I dont recommend upgrading your phone if your looking at the technology or ""what is new"" thing.",1,,0.015,0.117,0.9803

The S25 also uses an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which in theory should struggle with glass screen protectors, but Samsung‚Äôs sensors in the past couple generations have gotten good enough to deal with it (and amfilm stopped making the good ‚Äòhybrid‚Äô film screen protectors a couple S phones ago).

Comment,S25,"Hey.

I have S series, and I will tell you this about charging 

I have been using my phone for more than a year, and here is my experience:

I always used battery protection, and when I plug my 45w charger, it takes 30 minutes to charge 80%. The next 20% will take another 30 minutes because after 80%, the battery gets stressed. Also, less than 20% makes the battery stressed.

What makes 45w great? Well, what matters is it will charge in 30 minutes whenever you're us8ng phone or not it won't effect. On the other hand, my brothers realme and poco phones with 90w charger, it doesn't fast charge if you use the phone. It will slow charge instead. The phone screen must be off for 90w charge.

Now we get to the point where you charge your phone overnight. I don't mind that, but there is a great way to keep battery healthy while keeping the phone charged

Comment,S25 Ultra,"My husband and I both purchased the unlocked S25 Ultra from Samsung. After getting the run-around from Xfinity customer service a few days ago, I finally got an answer that they wouldn't be ready to activate until 2/7 (because that was the offical release date set by Samsung eventhough they shipped them out much faster). So here we are on 2/7 and still getting the same message that the phone is locked to the previous carrier.¬† My only thought is that maybe, MAYBE it's because it's still early in the day and they'll have all the unlocked IMEI #'s in the system by tonight (fingers crossed).


I tell you, though, after the horrible experience I had with customer support the other day (I know, big surprise) if these phones don't work by the end of today, we'll be switching to a different provider. It's bad enough that they now charge $20/mo for insurance when I was able to get it through Samsung for so much cheaper through Samsung directly, for BETTER coverage. If I can spend a few dollars more per month somewhere else for better customer service, it may be worth it! It'll probably balance out with how much I'm saving on insurance now, though it would've been nice to just save some $.¬†

Seriously, take the pen away (which a move like this, combined with attempting to do it with the S21, hints at), and I'll just jump brands - prob to OnePlus.


It honestly feels like they were tired of people complaining the Folds don't have full pen functionality, and that they were giving an inferior pen experience on the most premium model, their Folds, so rather than find a way to make it work, they stripped away functionality on the Ultra Pens.",2,,0.069,0.097,0.5719

Comment,S25 Ultra,"I used to be an S Ultra sheep myself, but here goes, listen to my heretical truth:
25 Ultra has a primitive 8 bit colour depth screen (only 16 million colors) . The whole Xiaomi 14 series and Xiaomi 15 series have 12 bit colour depth screens (a whopping 68 billion colors). Flagship cameras take pictures and videos at 12 bit colour depth. Try to view them on an 8 bit screen and you'll see horrible ""banding"". Read a few articles about it: most humans CAN see the difference in quality between 12 bit / 10 bit screens and the old hat 8 bit screens. I see a huge difference...the S25 has no DolbyVision certification because that's impossible on a primitive 8 bit screen. The S25 Ultra uses an algorithm to fake HDR10 certification, because yes the ""10"" in HDR10 stands for '10 bit'. Stop being a sucker...
S25 Ultra has super slow 45W charging with a bad implementation which only charges a few minutes faster than the old Samsung 25W charging. The Xiaomi 14 series and Xiaomi 15 series charge at either 90W or 120W depending on the model, and even have 80W wireless charging, the S25 Ultra just 25W wireless charging...
The Xiaomi 14 and 15 series uses far superior silicon-carbon battery tech, the S25 series... doesn't...
And the Xiaomi 14 and 15 series have far superior camera hardware, giant 1 inch sensors, stepless variable aperture etc, which Samsung doesn't have...
I'm just using Xiaomi as an example, but the same superior hardware is available on many different Chinese phone brands...
The S25 Ultra is a phone for people who don't know anything about phones...
To add insult to injury, Samsung says you can't have 16Gb RAM on your S25 Ultra if you live in the western world, 16Gb RAM is ""Asia only"". Samsung is making their utter contempt for you very clear...the S25 Ultra with just 12Gb RAM in the US and Europe isn't an ""Ultra"" at all, it's just a mediocre ""Pro"" at best...

Samsung is turning into Apple

So if you're a masochist who gets a kick out of getting ripped off, or a sucker who wants to reward Samsung for their thundering disgrace of failure to innovate, and failure to keep up with China, then get the S25 Ultra üòÇ

And, for me, the most ridiculous is that mid range Samsung phones have the SD card slot and they are just basically trying to milk the high end users instead of giving them all the features. It's sad and ridiculous.
Since all the complaints we can make, we are still a very niche part of the market, so Samsung doesn't really care as apparently they did back in the times (e.g. when the added a lot of features back into the S7 after removing them in the S6).

Comment,S25 Ultra,"I was against iOS for a long time. I tried switching several times and kept returning to Android. The problem is there are too many choices on Android when it comes to the best phone. The experience is different on a Pixel compared to a Samsung. 

I finally switched for good back in April to the iPhone 15PM. I knew my kids would be getting iPhones soon, which they did. It makes it easier to keep track of them and set parental controls on their phones. They are 15 and 12. iMessage and FaceTime are apps that are indispensable. 95% of the people in my life are on iOS, it just made sense to switch. 

I no longer find myself comparing new phones or looking for an opportunity to trade in what I have on the newer phones. 

One of the reason I wanted to switch was to get an Apple Watch too. I now use a Garmin as I hated the square watch design and I feel like Apple Watches are too fragile and susceptible to getting scratches or cracks on the screen unless you get an Apple Watch Ultra, which I was never going to do. I‚Äôm content with my iPhone but I also have a Lenovo 12.7 Pad Pro that I use as well. I don‚Äôt see myself ever getting an iPad as they are too expensive. Especially considering the deal I got on my Lenovo tablet. 

One of the reasons I‚Äôm content on iOS is because they finally introduced themes and moving icons anywhere on the screen. I‚Äôll admit though, once I get my app icons where I like them, I never move them or change the layout or theme of them. My goal in using a phone is being able to find and open the apps as quickly as possible. I don‚Äôt care how it looks when I‚Äôm scrolling through the screens. 

I will say I still hate typing on my iPhone. Autocorrect and text prediction sucks. I got used to typing on gboard where it would learn my typing habits and was pretty good at predicting my words for me above the keyboard. Gboard can be installed on iOS, but it still reverts to the Apple keyboard when typing passwords and security sensitive information. I‚Äôm hoping that my typing will get better as time goes on.",23,,0.033,0.096,0.9775

What ends up happening is that you have different directions back gestures for different apps, with some apps lacking it altogether. After a while though it becomes muscle memory.

Keyboard is meh - you can download a replacement one however (such as G board - the default android one) - you still have to use the iOS one for passwords and sensitive info though (for security reasons)

The display being unresponsive doesn‚Äôt sound right - perhaps you have a faulty unit - apples displays and software are equivalently quick to most android skins (I believe that the pixel is faster than all in that department). I‚Äôd recommend popping into an Apple Store to have it looked at (they‚Äôll do it for free üôÇ)

True, each system has its own advantages and its own frustrations. Also true, people locked into a single system HATE the learning curve when changing to the other system, then many will discover there is no perfect system and have to decide which cons are unacceptable to them and which pros are mandatory to them. 

For me, a memory card slot is mandatory (so that leaves out iphones). Also, when EU rules take effect in a couple years and phones are required to have user-replaceable batteries (remember those?), I will be adding that to my required list.

Not ONCE did i think about switching to Apple because the reasons are what you stated and they are seriously overpriced for limited functions. The back button is such an essential thing and I am glad Samsung retained it still. Only thing I am disappointed in is the removal of headphone jack.",1,,0.09,0.041,-0.5859

Comment,S25,"I had the S8, S20 and S22 (all base models as I prefer those). And i had them all with exynos chips so basically worst battery life possible.

Now I had to buy the S24 which also came with exynos but im actually really happy with it. I can last 2 days @120hz with my usage. 

With the s20 and s22 I didn't even use 120hz due to their battery, which always felt like a waste of spec.

And from what I've seen in tests, Samsung is no longer behind in terms of battery.
I was planning on getting the S25 if it had a guaranteed snapdragon chipset but honestly: no more.
The base S24 does the job really well for me.

I don't think battery life is a reason to switch to Apple anymore...",1,,0.077,0.102,0.7041

Comment,S25 Ultra,"Hey dude, 

Little late to the party, but just in case I can be of any help to anyone.

First to address the autocorrect and typing with iPhone.

The smaller models of iPhones e.g. the 13 pro V pro max, I feel that the biggest issue is just the size of the keyboard/screen, when I was mainlining the 13Pro I felt like I had a lot of typing errors that I was constantly fixing for a while, but when switching to my girl's iPhone 14 pro max, I had ""slightly""* better typing. 

*Obviously i assume this must just be from moving from a smaller screen to a larger one, giving me more room to type than I'm use to.
But this makes me believe that no matter what, a larger screen just feels better to type on. 

Now with that said, the autocorrect on the iPhone, I personally felt was a little better than gboard, in most aspects, but this will simply be due to the fact I'd had two generations of iPhone before purchasing the s24 ultra, therefore I'd spent a sizeable chunk of time using the autocorrect, allowing it to learn the way I speak, the slang, shorthand notes etc. Because of the cloud, all of that transfers between iphones and makes the process easier, gboard should sync across devices to do the same, although you may need to turn that on in settings somewhere (of course this would have to be the same profile signed in on both old and new devices) 

TLDR for the above paragraph: If you stick with the apple keyboard, it will get better eventually, just give it some time to learn. 

Additional security comment: The biggest selling point for me with apple, besides the simplicity, is the security that comes with a closed ecosystem, so I would try to use apple's own services whenever possible to avoid any possibilities of your information being stolen, even though it's highly unlikely, you'd may as well take advantage of that free security system. 

With all that said, I do not like the new iPhone 16 what so ever, neither the 15 or 14,  all were underwhelming, not worth the price and as you've mentioned, responsiveness=bad
Gestures=bad (compared to s24 anyway)
Gallery app=ruined by new update, can scroll to the bottom to edit and untick categorys to clean it up a bit, but still bad.

Although I understand all that may be pointless as you're switching to the s24/s25 anyway.

In this case, I'd do what I should've done, wait until the s25 drops, check for any promotions via Samsung for free devices (I got a free galaxy watch 7 direct from Samsung, as I bought my s24 ultra through EE, although I think that promo ended on the 10th) then grab the s24 on a massive price drop, the screen and camera are going to be the same as s24 I think, so not much point in paying the extra for a phone with last gen hardware, when you can get the same hardware for cheaper, obv this depends on whether Samsung drop anything game changing with the s25, but so far, I don't think they will drop anything worth the price bump from a hugely discounted s24 ultra.

Hope this can help, or at least help someone with the same issues.",1,,0.046,0.121,0.9938

Samsung just announced regionalised AI in Romania whereas üçé hasn't yet put Romania on the official Apple store map. However, Samsung will probably ask money for their AI, not something enticing for me. Also Google lately seems worse as far as assistant goes, a few days ago I struggled to make it understand calling a friend whilst Siri recognised it from the first try.

Comment,S25,"When reading this, this seems like rightly deserved as it sounds like you did zero research.  you could have decided this with a few videos of ‚Äúwhat is like moving from android phone to iPhone‚Äù Also sounds like a much over exaggerating on every issue to get your point across.  

But to over exaggerate when I used a Samsung for a review I did, I‚Äôll give it a 1/10, will kill me if I look at it wrong.   Only they actually blew up.  But also Samsung UI is bad, and barely usable. While some customization is good, shoe horned in and needed to pay for it. Back button is unnecessary cumbersome and is unintuitive. 

The displays are literally made by Samsung so whose fault is that I wonder? Hmmm‚Ä¶

Over exaggerations aside, I actually disliked any Samsung I reviewed.  They are pretty, sure, but the overblown bloatware of a skin on Android is not needed.

Next time I hope you learn your lesson and actually do research before you spend $1500+",-1,,0.136,0.107,-0.8346
