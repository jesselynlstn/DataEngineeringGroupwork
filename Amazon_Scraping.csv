5.0 out of 5 starsAmazing!!,5,"This was a major upgrade for us, we went from a S9 to this S25.  It is amazing how fast it is and how much better it looks.We are still getting use to them, yet we love them.My husband got the S25 with the 256 memory I think it is and I got the S25 Ultra with the I think 512 memory.He didn't want a phone much bigger than his old S9 and I wanted a phone bigger than the S9.Mine isn't huge yet it definitely makes the regular one look smaller when I use his.They look sleek and very nice!!They are fast and I don't have any issues with lag or anything like that.",Silver Shadow,256 GB,S25
5.0 out of 5 starsLovely & Excellent Device. Suggestion for the Camera,5,"I love this device, but I have a suggestion for the professional camera. Please consider a camera update that allows for full manual adjustments, utilizing all the capabilities of the hardware. Currently, there are limits in place. For example, in astrophotos using the raw camera, the ISO can only be manually adjusted up to 3200, while AI allows it to go up to 8000. Although editing is possible afterward, I would prefer to set the camera for an optimal professional photo according to my preferences and the hardware's capabilities. Offering both options—AI & auto, and a fully manual mode without limits—would be fantastic. If anyone has been able to make all adjustments manually, please share your experience.",Titanium Silverblue,256 GB,S25 Ultra
5.0 out of 5 starsHappy with it.,5,"I'm still getting used to it.  But it's highly efficient, has added interactive features with my cars hands free system.  Great camera. When syncing with my old phone it transferred my data, apps. Pics, in seconds.  All had to do was transfer my SIM card from my old phone to this one and I was 100% functioning.  No need to call my career and go through the hassle of transferring phones.",Titanium Silverblue,512 GB,S25 Ultra
1.0 out of 5 starsInfinite boot loop 5 days after initial use,1,"This product locked up while using the camera app and subsequently entered an infinite boot loop 5 days after initial use. The phone would get very hot, and restarting would only allow it to shut down for 60 seconds, upon which it would begin the boot process, only to get stuck on the initial black samsung screen, again, and again. The only thing I could do was wait until the battery physically ran to zero, which was a long time, and then try again the next day, when i discovered that the problem was still present. Amazon was very helpful, and almost immediately issued a full refund due to a manufacturer defect. I am posting this because this is a new product, and hopefully it will help someone else that runs into the same problem. I will try again with a local store, and hope that this is just a one off problem.",Titanium Whitesilver,512 GB,S25 Ultra
5.0 out of 5 starsGreat phone,5,"I moved from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to this phone, so it's a big step up for me. I love it, considering it's my first Android phone.

5.0 out of 5 starsGreat phone!!!,5,"I upgraded from an S21, and dang this phone is nice! Better camera, better speakers, sharper screen. It's very, very snappy. But the S21 was fast too. I only have one gripe, and once Samsung fixes it I'll come back and change my review to five stars... It's no longer possible to have a 4x5 grid pattern on the home screens. The only options now are 4x6 or 5x6. I read in one forum that eventually it will be possible? I'm hoping that's the case. I thought the phone was going to be better in every regard but this particular limitation is a step down for me. Anyway great phone overall!Update: I've been using this phone for 5 days now and screw it, I'm moving my review to five stars even though I still can't do the 4x5 grid. This phone is amazing.2nd update: Not really an update, just that I forgot to mention how easy it is to transition from one Samsung to another. Literally all my apps on the other phone were downloaded to the new phone, it was so freaking easy to make the transition.",Navy,256 GB,S25

There is still a massive amount of work to do to get to the smooth operation of your previous phone. Battery life is definitely better with this phone. I am pleased with the purchase.",Icyblue,128 GB,S25
5.0 out of 5 starsGreat phone!!!,5,"I upgraded from an S21, and dang this phone is nice! Better camera, better speakers, sharper screen. It's very, very snappy. But the S21 was fast too. I only have one gripe, and once Samsung fixes it I'll come back and change my review to five stars... It's no longer possible to have a 4x5 grid pattern on the home screens. The only options now are 4x6 or 5x6. I read in one forum that eventually it will be possible? I'm hoping that's the case. I thought the phone was going to be better in every regard but this particular limitation is a step down for me. Anyway great phone overall!Update: I've been using this phone for 5 days now and screw it, I'm moving my review to five stars even though I still can't do the 4x5 grid. This phone is amazing.2nd update: Not really an update, just that I forgot to mention how easy it is to transition from one Samsung to another. Literally all my apps on the other phone were downloaded to the new phone, it was so freaking easy to make the transition.",Navy,256 GB,S25
5.0 out of 5 starsAwesome Deal!!,5,"I am an older person (65) and for yrs went to a phone store so I could have data transferred from my old phone to my new phone; and of course paying premium $$$ for the phone and the service.  NOT anymore!!  I bought this new Samsung and upon charging it literally walked me through Step-by-Step on how to transfer my phone data, contacts, apps, etc...and keeping my phone number.  I also received $200.00 from Amazon!!  So getting the best phone on the market at a great deal!!  I am not tech savvy AT ALL, so was so proud that I took this small leap of faith to do it myself (it was one of the easiest tech things I have ever done) and saved several hundred dollars by doing so!!  Love this phone!  The Camera takes excellent pictures and videos and the features are great!  Love also that I got back $200.00 Amazon gift card!!",Titanium Whitesilver,256 GB,S25 Ultra
CPU high temperature,1,CPU/battery reaches insane temperatures while phone is idle. Literally can not hold the phone as it is very hot. Double the temperature of another normal phone 70°c tracked with CPU Z APP,Titanium Black,256 GB,S25 Ultra
Fake/Scam/Unboxed Phone,1,Selling unboxed phone with a fake seal. I got the phone checked in the Samsung Store and they said it had already been activated before and is out of warranty.,Titanium Black,512 GB,S25 Ultra
"Samsung pay not supported, very disappointing",2,"Samsung Pay's not working on this thing!  I've tried everything, but it keeps saying it's not supported.  So frustrating, because it worked perfectly on my old Note 20.Something's wrong, or maybe it's region-locked—they don't say anywhere.  I wish I hadn't wasted my money and time.If you use Samsung Pay, don't buy it from this vendor; look elsewhere.",Titanium Black,256 GB,S25 Ultra

1.0 out of 5 starsDon’t turn it off,1,"I bought 2 iPhones in December for my daughters for Christmas. The first issue was with the pink one , we always turn off our devices and then charge them, the next we were unable to switch it back on. We tried multiple times to re charge , turn it on with no avail. Then we did the exact same thing with my other daughter’s (white)phone and the same thing happened a few weeks after that. Absolutely fuming! We sent the pink one back and I still haven’t received a refund -being told I’ll have to wait until end of Jan and ring them! We had to replace my daughter’s pink one as she was without a phone. Now this has happened with the white. So I’m Waiting for 2refunds-with a total of nearly £2k. I regret buying from Amazon as if it was a shop, they would have replaced it and I wouldn’t have to wait so long for a refund on such a high priced item, which is a fault of theirs not ours",Not specified,Not specified,iPhone16

1.0 out of 5 starsDon’t turn it off,1,"I bought 2 iPhones in December for my daughters for Christmas. The first issue was with the pink one , we always turn off our devices and then charge them, the next we were unable to switch it back on. We tried multiple times to re charge , turn it on with no avail. Then we did the exact same thing with my other daughter’s (white)phone and the same thing happened a few weeks after that. Absolutely fuming! We sent the pink one back and I still haven’t received a refund -being told I’ll have to wait until end of Jan and ring them! We had to replace my daughter’s pink one as she was without a phone. Now this has happened with the white. So I’m Waiting for 2refunds-with a total of nearly £2k. I regret buying from Amazon as if it was a shop, they would have replaced it and I wouldn’t have to wait so long for a refund on such a high priced item, which is a fault of theirs not ours",Not specified,Not specified,iPhone16

Camera control button a gimmick I know it’s there as it’s always in the way when using a case. Used it, we didn’t click. Battery is solid. I will stick with it as it plays nicely with other Apple stuff. 60hz no biggie, but always on display should be an option. Apple AI is still not here but it’s 2-3 years behind Google anyway so not sure it’s worth the wait.",Not specified,Not specified,iPhone16

5.0 out of 5 starsAmazing phone from Apple never disappoints.,5,"This phone is probably one of the greatest from the Apple line. The design is so great and the colour is outstanding the functionality is great and the strong outer casing feels nice in the hands. The battery life is great and lasts for hours on end and best things it’s light weight. The value for money is great because of its features, with the new camera button you can become a professional and take amazing stunning photographs. The 48 megapixel camera shows its potential in all areas and photos come out professional level. The 120 hz display is so good and feels smooth when using. Such an amazing innovation made by Apple this is one of this best phones yet. Really recommended for anyone.",Not specified,Not specified,iPhone16 Pro
5.0 out of 5 starsiPhone 16 Pro - 256GB.,5,"The iPhone 16 Pro has been a great upgrade option for me, combining a sleek design and built for the new Apple Intelligence features due to be released.The first thing I did notice is the new display - it feels crisp, vibrant. The improved refresh rate makes everything from scrolling to gaming feel incredibly smooth.Performance-wise, the new A18 chip delivers decent speeds, effortlessly handling multitasking and demanding apps - gaming on my iPhone feels a lot smoother and the phone itself just feels a lot faster compared to my old iPhone 13 Pro Max.The battery life has also seen a decent boost, easily lasting a full day even with heavy use - I often have my phone on low power mode, and still runs decently and the battery has lasted way over 24 hours despite using it often.The camera system, always a standout feature for the Pro models, has been further refined.The improved low-light performance is actually insane to be honest, and along with the new AI-enhanced photography tools, it allows for stunning photos and videos in any condition.The new camera button on the iPhone 16 Pro is actually incredibly useful and it can be customised to open various apps - it felt a little weird at first and the button felt in the way, but I got used to it after a day or so.The only downside to be honest, is that the outer black titanium case feels plasticky oddly - I think it feels rather cheap, but I have my phone in a Spigen hybrid case, so it doesn’t bother me that much.This iPhone 16 Pro - comes with the new Apple braided USB-C cable and a sim pin.Unfortunately, and rather disappointingly - Apple has decided to remove the stickers.

5.0 out of 5 starsWorth the upgrade,5,"Very good phone. The delivery driver had to take a code on delivery to prove it’d actually been given to me which I think is very smart on Amazon’s part. It came well packaged and completely undamaged.It’s a good and fast phone was lots of storage. It’s very easy to set up from another iPhone too (takes about 10 minutes to upload data from the cloud).However, it doesn’t currently have Apple intelligence on it. Apple isn’t releasing that until around December 2024, despite Apple intelligence being the primary selling point (so probably not worth the upgrade if you already have an iPhone 15 but worth it for any below).Overall the design is sleek, the camera is next level and the action button being customisable is a nice touch.Worth the money.",Not specified,Not specified,iPhone16 Pro

The improved refresh rate makes everything from scrolling to gaming feel incredibly smooth.Performance-wise, the new A18 chip delivers decent speeds, effortlessly handling multitasking and demanding apps - gaming on my iPhone feels a lot smoother and the phone itself just feels a lot faster compared to my old iPhone 13 Pro Max.The battery life has also seen a decent boost, easily lasting a full day even with heavy use - I often have my phone on low power mode, and still runs decently and the battery has lasted way over 24 hours despite using it often.The camera system, always a standout feature for the Pro models, has been further refined.The improved low-light performance is actually insane to be honest, and along with the new AI-enhanced photography tools, it allows for stunning photos and videos in any condition.The new camera button on the iPhone 16 Pro is actually incredibly useful and it can be customised to open various apps - it felt a little weird at first and the button felt in the way, but I got used to it after a day or so.The only downside to be honest, is that the outer black titanium case feels plasticky oddly - I think it feels rather cheap, but I have my phone in a Spigen hybrid case, so it doesn’t bother me that much.This iPhone 16 Pro - comes with the new Apple braided USB-C cable and a sim pin.Unfortunately, and rather disappointingly - Apple has decided to remove the stickers.

The design is so great and the colour is outstanding the functionality is great and the strong outer casing feels nice in the hands. The battery life is great and lasts for hours on end and best things it’s light weight. The value for money is great because of its features, with the new camera button you can become a professional and take amazing stunning photographs. The 48 megapixel camera shows its potential in all areas and photos come out professional level. The 120 hz display is so good and feels smooth when using. Such an amazing innovation made by Apple this is one of this best phones yet. Really recommended for anyone.",Not specified,Not specified,iPhone16 Pro
5.0 out of 5 starsiPhone 16 Pro - 256GB.,5,"The iPhone 16 Pro has been a great upgrade option for me, combining a sleek design and built for the new Apple Intelligence features due to be released.The first thing I did notice is the new display - it feels crisp, vibrant. The improved refresh rate makes everything from scrolling to gaming feel incredibly smooth.Performance-wise, the new A18 chip delivers decent speeds, effortlessly handling multitasking and demanding apps - gaming on my iPhone feels a lot smoother and the phone itself just feels a lot faster compared to my old iPhone 13 Pro Max.The battery life has also seen a decent boost, easily lasting a full day even with heavy use - I often have my phone on low power mode, and still runs decently and the battery has lasted way over 24 hours despite using it often.The camera system, always a standout feature for the Pro models, has been further refined.The improved low-light performance is actually insane to be honest, and along with the new AI-enhanced photography tools, it allows for stunning photos and videos in any condition.The new camera button on the iPhone 16 Pro is actually incredibly useful and it can be customised to open various apps - it felt a little weird at first and the button felt in the way, but I got used to it after a day or so.The only downside to be honest, is that the outer black titanium case feels plasticky oddly - I think it feels rather cheap, but I have my phone in a Spigen hybrid case, so it doesn’t bother me that much.This iPhone 16 Pro - comes with the new Apple braided USB-C cable and a sim pin.Unfortunately, and rather disappointingly - Apple has decided to remove the stickers. Sad times.Overall, the iPhone 16 Pro is a powerhouse device that pushes the boundaries of what a smartphone can do - I highly recommend the iPhone 16 Pro!",Not specified,Not specified,iPhone16 Pro
5.0 out of 5 starsValue for money,5,"Great product, got it for the Mrs as a gift and she’s loved it for day1. The hold colour gives it a very unique look and the feel is really nice. Apple got this product right. The battery life is great and doesn’t weight heavy.",Not specified,Not specified,iPhone16 Pro
"1.0 out of 5 starsDon’t do it, go direct",1,"After care service, was sent defective iPhone and after care service was not helpful, it’s not a cheap phone and to get one with battery defect is not good enough I would recommend buying direct from manufacture.The product support is not good, my original review was taken down too, I had to repost again briefly",Not specified,Not specified,iPhone16 Pro
5.0 out of 5 starsLove it,5,my boyfriend has he wanted an upgrade on the old iPhone this came down very quick came down in great steady packaging. The phone was absolutely perfect and absolutely fine. Love the Culla of the phone. The camera on this phone is amazing as you can hear we are an iPhone family.,Not specified,Not specified,iPhone16 Pro
5.0 out of 5 starsWorth the upgrade,5,"Very good phone. The delivery driver had to take a code on delivery to prove it’d actually been given to me which I think is very smart on Amazon’s part. It came well packaged and completely undamaged.It’s a good and fast phone was lots of storage. It’s very easy to set up from another iPhone too (takes about 10 minutes to upload data from the cloud).However, it doesn’t currently have Apple intelligence on it. Apple isn’t releasing that until around December 2024, despite Apple intelligence being the primary selling point (so probably not worth the upgrade if you already have an iPhone 15 but worth it for any below).Overall the design is sleek, the camera is next level and the action button being customisable is a nice touch.Worth the money.",Not specified,Not specified,iPhone16 Pro
