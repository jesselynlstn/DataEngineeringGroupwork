Post,iPhone 16,iPhone 16 or Samsung S24? ,36,150.0,2024-11-07,0.0,0.0,0.0
Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,Really personal preference. Both have great cameras. Both have good batteries but I think s24 wins. Personally I have used both throughout the years and have an iPhone 12 now and a pixel and I wouldn't get another iPhone I don't think. Their really falling behind in innovation. I'd probably go s24 or pixel but that's just me.,11,,2024-11-07,0.034,0.19,0.8912

Comment,iPhone 16,"Having worked with both (I test applications and push management solutions) you can’t fault the 16 PM. For the average user whichever ecosystem you are part of. But imo, and colleagues, Apple devices are the superior device. Fantastic build quality, better battery life by quite a bit due to how Apple manage the OS, never slow down (all android devices seem to significantly slow down over time), much better stock photos and video quality is better. We’ve also noticed the sound and voice quality when making calls is  superior on the 16 PM using the same SIMs and WiFI. Though privacy is a concern regardless, Apple do a much better job with privacy than Android.

Both great phones, won’t be disappointed with either but unless you are using custom apk’s, loading ROMs or doing some funky stuff (which I really like the Android for) - the 16PM is just a better device overall. No hate against either really, these are just negligible things that both are great at.",1,,2024-11-08,0.036,0.253,0.9944

Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"Snapdragon S24 will always be better choice over stock 16 but with the pro since it has pro motion display, it gives it a more challenging debate. Personally I've used an S24 and had the 15 pro. the S24 is truly an amazing phone but obviously it has its downsides with software and ui sometimes. Iphone is just too basic can't even do split screen multitasking like the samsungs. 

It's pretty much up to preference on more freedom open experience like using a windows computer, just have so much to do with an android it's like you're always learning something compared to IOS it's just the same maybe slight changes here and there.

Comment,iPhone 16,"If you live in the U.S., I think Samsung.com gives you a two-week trial period. I have both the iPhone and the S24. Some people prefer the iPhone pictures, and some people prefer the Samsung pictures. Sometimes it might just be individual choice. You'll still have great pictures, but I think it depends on what else you're looking for. For me, Samsung feels like an overall great experience with extra perks like Dex. Some people say the iPhone has better video capture. And if you're a big social media person, then uploading to Instagram, etc., will be better with the iPhone.

Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"i'd say 16 would be better than the S24. But if you are talking about the S24 Ultra then it would depend on your preference and your experience with your Iphone 12 pro. One thing i hate about Iphones is the battery issue and the temp, but their UI is so damn smooth in comparison to Samsung. Just go to a store and see how the two phones feel in my honest opinion. I'd go for the latest phone over if i was in your shoe, and depending on the condition of your phone as well as you home country, apple exhanges are hella wicked when it comes to upgrading to the latest iphone in the form of apple credits, i got the full exchange rate for my 15 pro which had a battery life of 79% and over all in good condition.

The s24U is not a bad phone at all though, especially battery, photo editing AI, and fun apps, its just 16 being a new phone has advantage over the year old Samsung series.",1,,2024-11-24,0.072,0.13,0.8764
Comment,iPhone 16,"After testing both myself S24U has better Photos/Zoom and Iphone 16pm has better Video.
I find myself taking more photos and multi-media useages. And Iphone I find is VERY limiting in terms of software compared to an android to most things and I was shocked on what you can and can't do on Iphone that Android been doing forever (Also I prefer Samsungs Gboard way more Iphones is very plain) Although I like the Apple Ultra 2 WAYYYYY more then the Samsungs Ultra watch so that's Iphones saving grace but imo not enough to say I'd prefer Apple over Samsung. 
The only real reason people use and stay with Iphone that I never hear on reviews is that you have an Iphone... which is stupied. It tells me people have no identity you'd be an NPC only following what insert celebrity is saying when even they are clueless. 
The best case for liking Iphone is you genuinely love the IOS and been using it forever and have a built ecosystem. If you had a chance to change or get into a phone I'd recommend Samsung, and if your Older user Iphone as it's super simplified and ""easier"" to teach.",1,,2024-11-29,0.033,0.163,0.9846

Comment,iPhone 16,"Depends on what you want the phone for.   First,  don't let the other comments mislead you,  the camera on the s24 ultra has tons of bugs in it and doesn't take as good a picture as the iphone 16.  I have used both, yes the s24 can zoom in on the moon but basic pics dont come out to the quality galaxy users are used to.  My old S10 took better pics.  Hopefully this is fixed in a future update but nothing yet.

Second, if you have the iPhone and have family members who also have iphones it becomes more difficult to interact and share things.  I share subscriptions with my family and have parental settings on my kids phones and cannot do that easily with the Galaxy, this may not apply to you.

Other than the camera, The S24 overall is the better phone in my opinion, I have used both and love the Samsung ecosystem but have family with iPhones and apple makes it too easy to ""keep it in the family"". But if you aren't a camera snob and don't need to utilize the apple ecosystem then I would go with the Galaxy.  Hope this helps.",1,,2024-12-29,0.034,0.174,0.9868
Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"I think personal preference at this point, depends on how you're going to use it, but for an average person, both are good phones. Although nobody cares about my opinion, but honestly one of the biggest downfalls for me with iphones is the glass body. It breaks, and replace it costs 200-300$ so I probably would go about durability here rather than fashion. I regret buying an iphone myself and I am stuck with a shattered phone until it dies and I will replace with a titanium, or metal phone whichever that is at this point.",1,,2025-01-02,0.092,0.106,0.3612

Was using androids since last 14 years and Bought the iphone 16 Pro max 10 days back… I am satsisfied till now… I also upgraded from Oneplus 7 pro which I had since 2019 … the one thing I noticed is apps are so much refined on iOS and that makes the UI so smooth and on 16 PM battery is very good till now
And cameras are good enough even if u don’t do manual settings in camera.
In India I have seen Samsung galaxy Ultra phones got some display issues like green line 
 etc. and company didn’t replace them under warranty and otherwise Ultras are also good phones
But I will advise you should experience iOS once to feel it as even though it has some restrictions over android but for most people it ticks out most of the checkboxes but please dont go for Non PRO iPhones they aren’t worth their money in 2025

Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"I use the iPhone 16 Pro for video recording and the S25 Ultra for photos. At this point, if you're struggling to operate iOS or Android, you must be a complete tool. They’re different for a reason, and both are great at what they do.

iOS excels in seamless integration, optimizing both pictures and videos for social media since Apple controls the entire ecosystem. On the other hand, Android falls short because developers don’t prioritize optimization across multiple brands like Samsung, Google, and Oppo etc., each using different formats. Essentially, Android’s processing is a copy of what the sensor picks up, whereas iOS fine-tunes it through direct coding.

Battery life and cross-device synchronization are just as good on Windows with Android as they are within the Apple ecosystem. However, Samsung is slowly adopting Apple’s approach. For me, battery life, fast charging, and an integrated clipboard are key.

I currently use the S23 Ultra (512GB) as a content creator, but I struggle with poor-quality uploads to Instagram and WhatsApp, even though the images look crystal clear on my phone. Because of this, I canceled my S25 Ultra (1TB) order to wait and see what the iPhone 17 brings. If I do switch to an iPhone, my 2024 Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (32GB, RTX 4070, 1TB) will likely be replaced by a 14-inch MacBook with the M4 chip.

People act like they need to be brand ambassadors for iOS or Android, but at the end of the day, these companies are taking our €1500+ they should be giving us the best of both worlds. I’m not superhuman, but I make both iOS and Android work for me!",1,,2025-02-19,0.016,0.102,0.9732

AI and circle to search

Fingerprint scanner

Front camera cutout is way smaller

Brightness (especially outside)

Closing all programs with 1 click7x5 rows not possible on iPhone

S-pen

Resizing widgets takes 2 seconds

Faster charging speed S24 Ultra is able to get up to 39% in 15 minutes, then to 79% in 30 minutes. In contrast, the iPhone gets to 29% and 55%Multi app tab is phenomenal

Camera zoom

BACK BUTTON or Swipe (Love the button)

All caps easier

Swift keyboard among other keyboard options

Brave browser eliminates ALL ads

I use a fake GPS app to watch nfl + live (ANY game live)

Resolution (500 PPI Vs 460)

Stacked widgets

IPhone camera has to be set Apple ProRAW and Resolution Control for 48 megapixels

Text shortcuts (ie BRB)

Noise canceling 2nd to none

Punctuation is much easier because of keyboard

Selecting words on Evernote easier when open

The stacked widget page on the iPhone opens up the programs too easily

Apps are WAY cheaper

Comment,iPhone 16,"I had an S24U for a while. I'm mainly an iPhone user. Honestly, S24U was a much better device than my 15PM in almost every regard. S24 had a brighter screen, seemed more fluid and snappy, and the 5G speeds I was getting on it was faster than my 15PM in areas where my 15PM typically received slower speeds. 

Customization that Samsung allows on S24U is awesome as well. Downloading launchers and customizing icons was a breeze. 

My biggest faults with the S24U at the time was the calendar didn't have a ""travel time"" feature telling you when you should leave to make it to an event based on traffic conditions; an infinitely useful feature I use on my iPhone daily. Also the speakers on the 15PM sounded slightly more full. Other than that Samsung really knocked it out of the park with the S24U in my opinion. Once the S25U comes back out I'll likely make the switch.",4,,2024-09-25,0.025,0.102,0.9231

But that's no surprise because both Apple and Samsung keep leap frogging each other every release. The upcoming S25 releasing in Jan - Feb 2025 will be better than the Iphone 16 Pro max. Then the Iphone 17 will release being slighter better than the S25.",2,,2024-09-23,0.04,0.146,0.8637
Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"In my opinion, I like both phones, but compared to S24U, iPhone 16 pro max gets slightly less preference. See, I'm a heavy AI user (not actual technical AI, the one Samsung introduced with the phone). With the recent update, AI is in its 2.0 version (imo) with Samsung, but Apple has yet to release it. Yes, they claim it to be better than Samsung, but Samsung has 7 months of feedback and what and how users want their AI to be focused. 

I do like iPhone video, but other than that, like most have mentioned, you get way more customization plus better hardware with S24U. 

For example, I will type the same thing I typed above with AI and see for yourself.

In my personal opinion, I find both phones to be quite impressive, however, when comparing the iPhone 16 Pro Max to the Samsung S24U, I slightly favor the latter. As a frequent user of AI features (specifically the AI introduced by Samsung), I appreciate the advancements made with the recent update, which I consider to be a significant improvement. While Apple claims that their AI capabilities surpass those of Samsung, it's worth noting that Samsung has had the advantage of receiving user feedback and refining their AI over a period of seven months.

Although I acknowledge the quality of iPhone videos, I must agree with the common sentiment that the Samsung S24U offers greater customization options and superior hardware compared to the iPhone 16 Pro Max.",2,,2024-09-26,0.0,0.202,0.9955

Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"Samsung also offers pretty good trade in values when the updated models are released.  Not to say Apple doesn't offer decent prices (and they do hold their value better). 

One thing I absolutely love on the S24U is the anti reflective coating. Everything looks so much better.  I don't use the S pen much but even as a camera remote it's very handy (alongside jotting notes down when pen and paper aren't around).  

Lots of options for home screen organization.  Currently using Niagara Pro (expensive app but I'd recommend trying it out for 7 days as it's helped cut down my screen time).  

The only thing that really attracts me to the 16P or 16PM is the video and the four microphones but with how much space videos take up I've been trying to cut down.

Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"i think iPhone-16-Pro-Max is better choice because if you are not a zoom photographer, then shots on both the phones are pretty much equal (i dare say s24U is a bit overexposed but can be adjusted to right settings).Based on my comparisons, the iPhone 16 Pro Max generally performs better than the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, with Apple's A18 pro chip providing a significant edge in single-core performance and overall power, even though the S24 Ultra may have more RAM; however, the difference in real-world usage might not be noticeable for most users depending on their needs. Key points to consider:

* **Chipset advantage:**The iPhone 16 Pro Max has the newer and generally considered more powerful A18 Bionic chip compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the S24 Ultra. 
* **RAM difference:**While the S24 Ultra has more RAM (typically 12GB) than the iPhone 16 Pro Max (usually 8GB), the iOS optimization often mitigates and outperforms the need for as much RAM. 
* **Software optimization:**Apple's iOS is known for its smooth performance and efficient resource management, potentially giving the iPhone an edge in everyday use.
* The ram on S24U is bigger but even a 14 pro max can outperform it in Frames consistency  on AAA games or heavy games (sorry android users). The optimization on ios is very heavy compared to androids leading in an overall win for iPhone-16-Pro-Max according to your requirements.
* Videography on iPhone-16-Pro-Max is unbeatable by any android phone due to the fact that Apple in their phones provide special encoders (Apple Pro res 4444HQ) which will take space but the quality of that video will be remarkably different than S24U (even if they have 8k 30fps) the 4k 120 fps outperforms due to the coders.
* Mic quality on iPhones are the best ones not forgetting the clear audio feature in photos app.
* Cons :- iOS is pretty boring in long term usage so keep switching every 4 years between iPhones and Samsung for freshness.
* Long battery life by 32% on iPhone-16-Pro-Max than S24U (even after having 559 mAh capacity more than iPhone-16-Pro-Max) indicating the optimisation.
* Lithiography on iPhone-16-Pro-Max is 3nm while on S24U is 4nm",1,,2025-01-17,0.018,0.124,0.9927

Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"As a long-time Android user curious about iOS, I’ve been debating this decision all week. This morning, I finally pulled the trigger on the iPhone 15 Pro Max. I took a chance on a refurbished unit listed in excellent condition on eBay for $800, saving $400 compared to a brand-new 16 Pro Max.


After researching the differences, I found that the 16 Pro mainly offers a new camera button, photographic styles, a slightly larger screen with thinner bezels, and a more powerful processor—about 15% faster in CPU performance. It’s also more efficient, leading to roughly ~20% better battery life. However, after watching several side-by-side comparisons on YouTube, I noticed no perceptible difference in performance.


Aside from battery life, which I was willing to compromise on, and the 15PM should still gave decent battery, none of those upgrades were important to me.",1,,2025-02-20,0.014,0.123,0.9402
Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"I was in your position with an iPhone 11. The 16 Pro Max just feels underwhelming, there is barely any difference between the 15 Pm and 16PM, that's why I decided to switch to an Android. If the 16 PM at least had 12Gb of RAM, I would've bought it because we are at the limit of current RAM capacity and phones need a bit more for all the new AI features that will come and should run locally. ( Check of the increase in Macbooks from 8 to 16 just because of Apple Intelligence that needs 16 to run properly). That's my story and opinion. 

The 15PM would be a better value if you can find it cheaper since the 16 with the camera button feels useless and it isn't that much better spec wise, no ram difference and a marginally better camera ( just the Ultra wide got a serious boost ). If you can wait for the 17, I would do that in hopes that will be a bit more future proof in terms of specs.",0,,2025-02-15,0.044,0.111,0.9217

Comment,iPhone 16,"I've had iphone for 6 continuous years then made the switch to samsung s24 and here's my honest opinion:

They are both amazing, good speakers, great signals, beautiful design and premium feeling, both are extremely fast, only downside is my s24 (exynos) camera is poor and sucks while I've noticed other Androids don't do that and tbh idk why samsung put exynos chips in s24, s25 is not like that tho it's way better so no worries 😂

What i really like about apple is icloud, how everything is so well put together and everything synchronizes so seamlessly
I mean sure samsung does it too but in my honest opinion apple is better at that and more secure like u won't lose ur files ect

BUT it doesn't have the amount of features that samsung offers, like ur able to sideload, emulate literally gta and pc games on it and it will run just fine, lots of customizing, samsung DEX (it's turns ur phone into a computer) and many many more

Samsung also has their own earbuds, watches ect and sometimes they have a discount while apple doesn't do that, so that's also a huge plus

And the base models have the same chipset as the ultra model, 120hz screen, overall a better value with samsung 

In conclusion: u get so so much more with samsung it's packed with features that u don't even know they existed b4, tbh I dont think apple deserves to have such a huge price tag it just doesn't offer much like ur paying for the phone and it just feels a bit empty and boring (neither does samsung i think all phones and everything is overpriced 😭) but at least samsung gets discounts, sales and it's cheaper!
Apple is for users that just want a basic phone, secure and is good at what it does, samsung is for people who just want a phone that has everything, people who buy samsung obviously know about tech or at least a little information about it, while an apple user just buys a new iPhone without searching anything about it

S25 ultra is amazing device for pretty much any task you want. It creates great photos and videos (there are some specific things that iPhone does better and vice versa). If younlive outside US it might be interesting for you that you actually can use all the AI functions.

I used iPhone before, than I switched to Samsung and the main reason was camera, (s10 vs XS, samsung was miles ahead honestly 11pro cought up but honestly even when 13 pro was out the s10 was keeping up side to side) the way One UI works tho made me stay with Samsung (i also tried other android devices, but honestly nothing is up there for me, I always consider samsung and apple in final decision round.i might consider pixel in the next one, we will see.

Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"To simplify the comparison, the iphone 16 will get you better battery life and camera performance in general.

The S25 on the other hand, gives you a telephoto lens, so better shots past 3x, better performance in the chip, thinner bezels and a 120hz refresh rate screen. Imo the 60hz on the base iphone is particularly egregious for the price, and I wouldn't recommend it to basically anyone.

More importantly, if money isn't an issue I would advise you to look at either an iphone 16 pro/pro max for significant improvements everywhere (because apple wants you to). If you feel that you'll regret missing out on samsung's features, then you should just stick with samsung. The S24 is a perfectly good option provided it has the snapdragon in it, and the S24 ultra should be below its retail price now and is very similar to the S25 ultra, with pretty good camera performance that beats a base model iphone 16 in almost all scenarios.",2,,2025-02-24,0.037,0.172,0.9764

Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"I am just curious as to why you would consider buying something that you know is not as good? 

I think the one argument most people have against iOS is that it isn’t something different not to people familiar with iOS at least. You can’t have 3rd party apps and it doesn’t have the customisation Android offers. Many people prefer the keyboard on Android phones and the notifications. 

I have never used the features on Samsung that you have mentioned so I can’t comment on that. The Google apps I loved and used I could download from the App Store. The switch has been pretty seamless. Battery life and camera is amazing. 

I looked at the S25 and I was told in the phone shop that they were receiving so many complaints and returns they don’t recommend them anymore.

My experience with Samsung hasn’t been great, too much bloatware, a lot of bugs and poor longevity. I have given up on them. People leave iOS because they are bored and want different as it never really changes too much. This is something I like personally, I know what I’m getting iPhone is just iPhone it does what I need it too well and the products last a really long time. 

If I were you though I would stick with Samsung it’s what you’ve always had and have had a good experience with it. If you are losing features you use and already feel the Samsung is the better phone I think you will regret buying an iPhone.",1,,2025-02-24,0.068,0.118,0.9384

My operator allows to ""rent a phone"". Just like credit, but you can change phone to another model after 9 month.

My problems was - slower charge, no work profile, different gestures in apps and i dunno why, but it seemed to me that signal is worth. Like I often travel between cities and I noticed more 0 signal situations. Maybe it was just my specific phone issue, don't know. Also I didn't find how to separate volume sittings, like notifications cannot be muted if media volume is up, this was important to me.

So the correct analogy for you, is you should switch to iphone. Switching from the usual (or the status quo) can make one more creative. You're already pondering it for a reason. Always jump ship to new horizons.

I bought, have the Huawei P30 Pro and it has Leica camera lens. Plus it had great reviews. Great Night photography, zoom into the Moon, Macro is so good that you can see things you don't want to see with clarity. You can also use the manual function and pro camera as well.
First time in my life the phone kept jumping out of my pocket and after it jumping everywhere the front glass has shatters and so has the back.... so I'm also after another Phone now and I'm all for quality and sometimes that comes via Chinese flag ship phones like this Huawei P30 Pro and Xiaomi Mi Pro. It also had a brilliant camera and I found it better for music quality and the RCA Headphone socket.
I have had leads to my amp which I used with my iph4, a Samsung and the Xiaomi which sounded good. Now I have been playing via a Bluetooth and guess what... 🤔🔊😉 my iph4 iPhone 4 beats all of them for sound quality and also beats my Huawei P30 Pro.
The P30 Pro sounds awesome in my Ute but is absolutely yous less and can't even drive my retro Pioneer headphones or my Mitchell ones 😭😭😭🎧😭😭😭👎

Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"Personally i will always take an android phone over an iPhone. Yes the iPhone will better pictures (not by a lot, bit better) and will ingrate smoothly within it's ecosystem, plus i think it does look a bit better when it comes to social media (its why a lot of influencers use it). But God forbid you leave that ecosystem and you're fucked (excluding headsets). To get the best out of iphone you need to have an apple watch, macbook, and various other apple products. However with android your ecosystem is completely up to you. For example my S23+ can ""airdrop"" (in android it's quickshare) anything to both computers since i downloaded quickshare to them since both have blue tooth. One computer is a 10 year old hp laptop, the other a custom built gaming PC that's about a year old and has nothing to do with HP. It then connects to the Samsung watch, but could've gone with a Google watch if I wanted to. To my knowledge I couldn't do any of that with an iPhone.

Iphone is also really good at locking you into apple. If you need a new phone and don't like Iphones for whatever reason, switching from iphone is not that easy (iphone yo iphone is a piece of cake). It can be done, but it's not easy. However if you want to switch to a different android device, then so long as it's a new android device, it's pretty easy, and there's lots of options. There OnePlus, Sony, Pixel, Nothing Phone, and a plethora of other Samsung options just to name a fewand several options at cheaper prices.

As a side note I will say that quickshare is better than airdrop. The big reason why I say quickshare is better is because you can do it up to 10 gB a day (which is a fairly large amount) to any device, android or iphone, at distance provided they have internet access. This doesn't happen with iphone.

And if it's the ease of iPhone use that attracts it to you, with the S25 newest software update you can basically turn your Samsung into an iPhone anyway, but again iphone doesn't have that option for it's products. You can literally create a hybrid between the 2 systems for what you like best on android, but with iphone, it's really opened up customization, but not to the same degree as android.

However, if the biggest things you want to do is to take and share pictures with friends who also have iphones, and post pics to social media, then iphone may just be for you.",2,,2025-02-15,0.039,0.13,0.9925

Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"Unless video footage is your utmost important requirement then it's got to be S25 for me - personally I'd go Plus or Ultra though as you get a bigger and higher resolution display on both. 
Android and iOS are remarkably similar these days, and bizarrely Android (depending which skin) seems to be more stable and less buggy than iOS 18, and is seriously smooth these days too. On the flip side, Apple has caught up a hell of a lot on customisation.

The display on all S25's is better than on a regular 16 no doubt, and battery life will be similar. The AI capabilities are also leagues ahead if you're into that, and on Android you can generally just do more.

Apple lately had been bringing out faster chipsets than on the Android side, which in itself was strange, however the Snapdragon 8 Elite in the S25 series of phones is an absolute monster, currently ruling the roost. If absolute processor speed isn't an issue to you though, then may be worth considering either of the Pixel 9 Pro devices; especially, again, if AI is important. They tend to be a bit less feature packed than Samsung devices, but a bit more cohesive, with less bloat and faster updates. Also run the flavour of Android as Google intended it. The beauty of Android is there are just so many options - every manufacturer has their own take on it, and on what the device should be like. This has it's drawbacks though, namely that apps are often better optimised for iOS as they don't need to optimised for so many different types of devices.

Through all the testing being done between these two phones. Here it is:

* iPhone has the better overall camera.
* S25 has better zoom.
* Video is better on the iPhone.
* iPhone has the better battery life.
* iPhone is the winner when it comes to camera department and battery optimization.

But, with that said they are both good phones. You can't really go wrong with either one. If you want the one with the slighter more edge vs the other in the camera / video department, it's the iPhone.

Comment,iPhone 16,"In that price range, you can't go wrong with all three devices. 

Android vs IOS
If you have a lot of Apple stuff, choose the iPhone.
Otherwise I would go for the Pixel, it's just a super smooth Experience overall. Don't listen to all these Benchmark-4Heads. I'm using a P7p, which is still running super smoothly. Realtalk, that chip is not gonna be a issue. (Except you're gaming a lot) 


Camera
If your priority is Video, go for the iPhone. If you take 99% pictures, then the Pixel is the right choice. 
A mixture of both is the s25U. But personally, I don't like the pictures coming out of it. That's just preference.

If your main priority is the battery, you should choose the iPhone it the S25U. But this year, the s25U series has some issues in terms of battery I believe, not sure. 

These are just some points which you should consider. Overall it's just preference, because all of these are more than 90% of people will ever need.",-1,,2025-03-07,0.029,0.038,0.1454

Samsung - more versatile but also more difficult to adjust to using, 120 Hz, slightly better display, better AI, people are addicted to using the s-pen that comes with the ultra.

iPhone - 60 hz - however it performs slightly better and uses less battery when gaming, works seemlessly with other apple devices (mac, watch, etc.), slightly better battery overall, better security - less likely for viruses and bad actors, easier to adjust to using.

Ultimately both are good phones. The Samsung is a bit cheaper than the iPhone. Hope this helps you decide on which phone to get based on what is important to you.",2,,2025-02-08,0.05,0.246,0.9849

Recently, though, I discovered something. You can use a shortcut on iPhone to do almost the same thing. I tried it on my iPad, and it works great. The only downside is I have to ask Siri to run it on the iPad. But on an iPhone, it would be even smoother since you can program the double-tap feature to trigger the shortcut.

Here’s how to set it up:

1. Download the Google app from the App Store.

If samsung doesnt do it for you, I think taking it off from the list might be the good decision because even though oneui 7 looks better that wont fix ur cammera annoyance, as the cameras have not been improved since then sadly, on the S and the S+, its literally the same since yours, only the ultra changed a bit.

Pixel’s chip might not be an issue unless u are high res gaming, but I understand the battery concerns, thats true.

iPhone can be a big leap with ios, since u can straight up forget about 5 apps on the dock, split screen multitasking, or adjusting os animation speeds. It is really a nice os to use, I like it, but not if u are a man of customization. Its good for my mum tho :))

I would also take the oneplus 13 into consideration. Lovely phone really, compared to samsung, way better battery especially against your s22, faster charging, better screen a bit, very good cameras, I am satisfied with them, and the OS is known to be a snappy one to use in all positive manner.

Far less bugs than I've had on my 16 PM on ios18. It really comes down to what os you prefer and how much benefit you get from the Apple ecosystem. While I love my S25U I'm running it on my work line and using my 16PM as my daily personal device. All my family and most friends are on iPhones and iMessage and FaceTime are huge even though RCS does help the cross platform messaging a little bit. Also have several Apple TVs, M4 MBP, and an iPad so if you are deep into the Apple ecosystem, you definitely lose features you would have with the iPhone.

Beyond that, if you're accustomed to Android, you may find the iPhone restrictive and more difficult to use. I certainly did when I tried to move to iPhone.


If you are serious about trying iPhone to see if you like it, then you could do what I did: buy a used or refurbished device, then try it out for a few days or weeks so that you can see how it operates in real world usage. If you like it, you can keep it or swap it for a newer device. If you don't like it then you can just sell it back, and any money that you don't recoup will just be the cost of you ""renting"" the device.",1,,2025-02-06,0.06,0.088,0.7123

Even tho underneath it does have faster processor and a bit better cameras, as well as a bit better speakers from the stuff you'll notice, and probably marginally better camera life (or not so marginally given your phone is 1.5 year old).   
  
If you really want to switch to iOS, 15 Pro or 16 Pro are the only options now, tho I'd still just go Android in the same price range myself as they offer more, 3-4 times faster charging, some phones offer better battery life, arguably a bit better cameras, and more.",3,,2025-02-24,0.027,0.166,0.9568
Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"“Worth” is a very subjective thing.

Will the iPhone feel more “premium” than the A54? Yes, probably. Can the A54 do pretty much everything the iPhone can do in everyday use? Almost certainly.

So is that extra “premiumness” worth the extra money? That’s subjective and only you can answer that, maybe try an iPhone out in an Apple Store first, or use one of your friends’ to see how it feels.

Personally, I switched to iPhone after having Android phones from the very beginning up to the Pixel 3 and I probably won’t switch back now.

Android is more fun to use than ios imo and samsung has it own ecosystem.

Edit: if the Pixel ever ends up becoming better price to specs wise I could see myself switching to it, it definitely has a better camera than the OnePlus though the OnePlus isn't a slouch!",1,,2025-01-21,0.07,0.172,0.9706

The 16plus model is a closer comparison really.  Is there somewhere you can try both out in store to see if the lower 24 series (regular and +) will work for you?  And check some reviews for the exynos version (or wait to see if the 25 version comes with the snapdragon in Europe) to see how it compares. I don’t know if the iPhone is worth the extra - for me it wouldn’t be - but I am also in an all snapdragon area for the Samsung (and got a good trade in on Boxing Day to get the 24U),  I found the camera in the iPhone 14 disappointing and preferred my note 9 over the regular 14 overall, but you may prefer the iPhones.

Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"I’d say no.

The smoother user experience you’re referring definitely goes to the Galaxy. I have a 14PM and the user ex isn’t great since each update seems to just break more and more things. You can play around with any animation and you’ll be bound to find some way of making it drop framerate, stutter or bug out. Apple’s dev team have reached new lows in past 2 years. The S24 will certainly be smoother since it’s physically running at higher frame rates more consistently than any pro iPhone.

Performance aside, they’re both good on software support. Samsung are promising 7 years, whilst Apple make no claims but have a track record of supporting for 8+ years so it depends more on if you break the device before that lol.

If you like the AI, Galaxy is definitely the way to go too. Apple’s AI seems like a (very expensive) joke so far.",1,,2024-12-27,0.034,0.2,0.9807

The features is the biggest advantage for S24+, if you like to manage your files for example manually, you can do that on Samsung, iPhone requires special tricks or even paid software. The camera may be 90% as good as S24+, but it stays that good in all situations, whilst S24+ gets bad in various difficult situations. And the 3X is quite old unimpressive sensor on Samsung.

The iPhone cannot write any number with less than 2 buttons. There is no way to put the numbers above the keyboard. All my usernames, passwords, mails, have numbers. This would have been little inconvenience that would've grown over time.

- You get system updates quicker

- Vídeo & Photo - Samsung night Photos are Fake and shutter lag is annoying. When theres moviment Samsung get blurred Photos.

Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"I used Samsung for years, last on a Fold4. It wasn't reliable, Samsung service and support terrible.  Loved my Pixel 7 Pro, the pictures were the best.

I'm now on iOS due to the family. It is not as intuitive as I expected, the camera being quite a disappointment. iOS is best when you have other Apple devices. 

If family were not an issue I would probably be on the S25 Ultra with a warranty or the Pixel 9 Pro.",4,,2025-02-21,0.07,0.157,0.8527

Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,Shop the Pixel 9 Pro XL against the Samsung while you're at it. I debated between the two. Ultimately went Pixel for the camera and Gemini AI functions I'm digging.

Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"The iphone sixteen pro is going to have better frame rates and performance in general in gaming due to far superior optimization. the only thing you're really getting from samsung is the bigger screen. The snapdragon 8 elite, maybe more powerful on paper. But because of how good optimization is with iOS gaming, it's going to be better 9 times out of 10, there's quite a few games that have a 120fps options on iOS and that option doesn't exist on Android. There are also quite a few games that have higher max resolution options than android. If you really care about gaming, honestly, iphone is the way to go and if not, maybe a asus rog or red magic phone. The redmagic 10 is gonna be a lot closer in performance to an iphone than the samsung. I say this as a samsung user with s25 ultra right now. Honestly, for some reason for the past few years, samsung phones have been some of the worst  gaming phones in terms of android flagships. Also in terms of all around phone, the 16 pro is gonna be the best choice out of all of these imo. I'd take the s25 ultra over 16 pro or pro max but not the s25+. The sixteen pro takes better pictures/video and is gonna give you a better overall gaming performance than than the s25+ so like I said, at the beginning, the question is do you want the bigger screen, or the better camera and better gaming experience. I also do personally prefer one u I over I o, s, but that's somewhat subjective. Although I'd argue one u I has many features that I o s lacks that make it superior so if that's something you're considering I'd factor that too.",1,,2025-02-23,0.025,0.181,0.9951

Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"So a few things to think about as I jumped in September from an iPhone 13 to a Pixel 9 pro XL and my wife went to a Pixel 8 and both of us are super happy. Android in general is just way better than apple, your spam calls disappear l, your calls are much clearer with few issues, your camera is better, they are far more customizable, and there is a way bigger app selection in my experience.  If you want to jump, here are a few things to think about to save money
1. Think about an A model or FE model if you don't need the fastest or telephoto lens - Pixel 8a or S23Fe - not the greatest choice IMO
2. Look at a flagship refurbished from last year - best option to me.  Right now you can get a Pixel 8 Pro with 6 years of upgrades for $359 on eBay or Amazon refurbished very good quality level. These things look like new out of the box.  Not sure what ab S23 or S23 ultra is, but way cheaper than new
3. Look at a new OnePlus 13 or 13R Which are excellent but only have 4 years of updates. They are only $899 and $599 NEW though.  Really nice phones that will last
4. Go to more midrange,  but you sacrifice cameras a bit. My wife's Pixel 8 takes awesome pictures but no telephoto.
Pixel and Samsung promise 7 years and OnePlus 4 right now. Stay away from Motorola if you care about updates.
Personally based on your description, I would look at a Pixel 8 pro or an S23 or even S22 Ultra as a refurbished/renewed off eBay or Amazon.",2,,2025-01-12,0.03,0.141,0.9866
Comment,iPhone 16,"Depends if you want to go through the rigamarole of transferring all your stuff over to Android. If you're cool with that, the S25 will be one of the best android phones money can buy.

If you want to stick with iPhone for whatever reason, wait  until March for the SE4/16e. Same guts as the iPhone 16 for about half the price.",1,,2025-01-12,0.0,0.136,0.7964
Comment,iPhone 16 Pro,"S25 (s24) will be a great phone 

Main advantages 
1. Telephoto lens on base model (base iPhone doesn't have telephoto. You'd have to go pro)
2. 120 hz native refresh rate - iPhone base still has 60 hz
3. Samsung s24 base uses same chipset as premium ultra model. Base iPhone has worse chipset than pro model

iPhone I'm sure would be 'fine' but I'd say Samsung is better between the to 'base models'",1,,2025-01-12,0.025,0.138,0.7992

Comment,iPhone 16,"Personally, I'd do the s25. I trust the brand just as well, and its a whole new phone for you. And buying another iphone is really just buying the same thing that you currently have except a new battery and an extra button on the side for the camera control functionality. 

Speaking of that camera control functionality, have you actually held the new 16s in your hand? Because that button is placed so horribly that I'm not sure if its an actual usable experience or not. In my opinion, it should have been further up towards the top of the phone so that when you just... idk..
